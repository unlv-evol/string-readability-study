0,26fe1d42,"I found both more readable under different conditions. It seemed that several of the questions did not have any options that matched what I would think would be correct. I wish there was a fifth option 'None of these options' because I didn't like having to choose one of the given options because none of them were correct according to my interpretation. (Like in one of the tasks, there was a period in the code string but it was missing the period in the options, I can't remember the task number but it was one of the ""50 out of 100 score"" tasks.)",I think the interpolation helped me understand quicker but inconsistencies with spaces and symbols that were missing the the options provided often made me feel as though I just had to pick the answer I 'thought' was intended to be the correct one. I felt like the concatenation tasks I was more sure of what the correct answer should be including spaces and symbols (even if none of the given options were what I considered correct.),"I think my own bias makes me lean towards concatenation, however I found the interpolation much easier to read, but the spaces (and double spaces) were inconsistent and incorrect in the options on some of the tasks for both concatenation and interpolation so it made me hesitant to prefer either of them in the context of this study.","I am much more used to seeing concatenation, especially strict strong concatenation... but the task with the (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) frustrated me because it was not in a string so I would think it would be translated as 4 but the options didn't show that at all. So the rigid options that did not meet my expectations impacted my understanding more than either version.","Please provide a 5th option like ""none of these options"". Even if one of the options are correct, I did not like having to be forced to pick one, it skews my input on this study. I feel that close attention to detail and symbols was missed on several of these tasks which greatly distracts from the actual difference between concatenation and interpolation."
