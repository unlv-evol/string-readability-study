With concatenation, having all the strings separated with a plus sign made it confusing to visualize a final resulting string, interpolation on the other hand made it very simple to visualize the result of how a string variable being inserted in another string.  ","Concatenation definitely slowed me down because of the need to visualize the string as it goes through the arithmetic. With interpolation, I am less familiar with it and have seen it less, yet it made it simpler to understand code snippets.","For now I would prefer concatenation because that's what I've been taught and have been using for my whole programming experience, however, I would probably prefer interpolation if I had been taught it earlier. Maybe I will use interpolation more to get more practice to eventually be comfortable with using it over concatenation ","I had more experience with concatenation, and have been using it ever since I started programming, so I was more confident with whether or not I was right. With interpolation I only had a few experiences with it and was never really taught it, so I was really unconfident with whether my answers were correct. However I still think it is a bit more readable concatenation. ","Not really, interpolation and concatenation seem to have their respective uses. "
