This method helps create a more distinct code.","Yes, they did since it's easier for me to read concatenation, it allowed me to read and debug the code a lot faster.",String concatenation because of the easier readability. Interpolation made it harder to find what each variable would connect with which.,"I have no familiarity with string interpolation, so it was a lot more difficult to understand it. I've coded my whole life using concatenation, so it was naturally easier to understand it.",I think interpolation could use another symbol rather than { } because it sometimes gets hard to differentiate between a regular ().
