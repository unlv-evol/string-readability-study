0,9de0157a,"I think the string interpolation was easier to read because once you acknowledge that everything within the {} is the string being displayed, it became much easier to read","I think when I first started the survey, I forgot that the '+' sign was used for concatenation, so when I saw something like ""1 + 2 + 3 + 4"" my immediate thought was that it resulted in ""10"" and not ""1234""",I would chose string interpolation because I think it was easier to read. It was one of those things that you can just look at and immediately know what the resulting string is. My decision was influenced by the examples used in the previous steps of this survey,"My prior experience made it easier for me to understand when an element was a part of the string, or part of the string structure. For example something like ""({2} + {3})"" is different from ""{(2 + 3)}"". The first one outputs ""(23)"" and the second one outputs ""(2 + 3)""","Im not really sure how the readability of them can be improved, I think theyre both easy enough to understand"
