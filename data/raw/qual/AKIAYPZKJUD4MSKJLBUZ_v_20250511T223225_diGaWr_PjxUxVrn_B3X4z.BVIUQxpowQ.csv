0,e625e390,"I found interpolation much easier to read because it shows when it whether an immediate string is being printed or a string variable is, it can all be placed inside quotes as well ex. a = there; ""hello {a}""",concatenation took me longer to read and decode what was happening due to all the + signs.,interpolation because it was easier for me to read and I can type it out much quicker than the other method.,my prior experience had a lot to do with how well I could read and decode the code snippets. I have only been coding for around 2 years so it still took me a little bit to decipher all of the code.,"concatenation could do with less + signs being used, if parenthesis could be used to block together larger snippets of test/string then that would enhance the readability much more"
