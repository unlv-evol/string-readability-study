0,f02cbfc4,"I found string concatenation easier to approach and read. This is because of the ""+"" sign making it more clear for me to read quickly. For example, ""1"" + ""2"" makes it clearer for me to add them move t together, rather than reading them through brackets and parentheses.","Yes, advantages I experienced was that it helped me find more clearly what a code snippet would mean, I would have to analyze less words and letters and simply add them together to what the string concatenations were attached to. Challenges I experienced was understanding if a space was added during interpolation, which is when you use brackets/""}"" and have spaces between them.  ",I would prefer string interpolation. The factor on how I could assign words or key numbers towards words would be very helpful and help with speed significantly. I think it would help me more than with concatenation strings.,"String concatenation prior experience I had was with the ""+"" simple, it made it easy for me to understand as all I had to do was to put words together if the ""+"" symbol was there.","I believe string interpolation could be improved with readability if it was more clear whether ""{3}"" was a key number for a string, like 3 = apples, and ""{apples}"" with apples = 3 or if ""{3}"" just means the number 3 itself"
