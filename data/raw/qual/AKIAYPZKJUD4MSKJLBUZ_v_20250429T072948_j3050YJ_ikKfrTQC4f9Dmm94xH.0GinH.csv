When using concatenation and ints, it became confusing on what exactly was a string and what was just a number. The addition operator made it more difficult to read compared to having braces.","I feel like both had pros and cons. In some cases, I understood the snippets of code with concatenation, but as stated in the previous question, when numbers and ints started to get involved, it became more confusing, and I found myself preferring interpolation. Advantages I had experienced were my somewhat knowledge in concatenation and that's about it. ","I would choose interpolation for future programming tasks. Some specific factors include the use of curly braces to help distinguish it from concatenation, where as concatenation uses adding operator/","My previous understanding of string concatenation really benefitted me in the early questions, but after that, I wasn't too sure with my answers.",I would say for concatenation for there to be a better way to distinguish it to just using the regular operator.
