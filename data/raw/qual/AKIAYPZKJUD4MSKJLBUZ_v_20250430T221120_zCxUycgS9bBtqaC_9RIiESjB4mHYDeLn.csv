0,228f5b94,"I found string interpolation more readable than string concatenation because it integrates variable values directly within the string structure. For example, using ""Hello, {name}!"" is much cleaner and less error-prone than ""Hello, "" + name + ""!"". Interpolation reduces the visual clutter of multiple + operators and quotes, especially in longer strings.","Yes, interpolation made debugging easier. When using concatenation, I had to mentally piece together each variable and string fragment, which got confusing. With interpolation, I could quickly see the final format of the message. The biggest advantage was clarity—especially in examples with multiple variables.","I would prefer string interpolation for future tasks. It’s more concise, easier to read, and less likely to introduce formatting errors. The main factor in my decision is maintainability—interpolation makes it easier to update strings and catch mistakes.","I’ve had more experience with concatenation in the past, but learning interpolation here made me realize how much more efficient it is. While I was initially more comfortable with concatenation, interpolation quickly became intuitive, and I now prefer it.","One improvement for string interpolation could be adopting clearer visual separators or highlighting for embedded variables—especially in editors—so that variable names stand out more from static text. For string concatenation, enforcing or recommending the use of template-style functions could reduce confusion from long chains of + signs. Also, including whitespace handling within interpolation could prevent common formatting mistakes, such as missing spaces between words or variables."
