0,eda4c596,"Concatenation was more readable. I actually do not recall any exposure to interpolation until this survey, so I am unsure what it means. Concatenatio, thus, was more readable. However, the notation did look more simple than Interpolation.","I was able to debug the code snippets by process of elimination. However, I did not have much practice with interpolation. Concatenation was easy, but the former was not. Debugging was challenging yet fun because I felt I was discovering something new.","Concatenation, as notationaly I require less types of elements to implement, despite needing more total elements / code required. However, I can see why some can see it as mundane and choose interpolation.","Requiring me to complete 16 tasks made it feel like trial and error, which was very good for my learning, as I was slowly picking up the pattern, like a machine learning model being trained.","Concatenation is where it needs to be, interpolation could be simpler. But I am not sure what could be implemented. As such, I am fine with the way they are now, leaving people to choose which they prefer for their coding projects."
