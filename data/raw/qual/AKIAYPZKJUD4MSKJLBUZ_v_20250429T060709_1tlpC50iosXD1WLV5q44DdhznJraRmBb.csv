0,07fee40e,A lot of these were trying to ensure the participant looks closely for spacings and to see if they knew if interpolation would print regardless of quotation marks. I looked closely at the given code snippets and looked back and forth on each answer choice through a process of elimination.,"Each question took some time simply because of the way these questions are formatted, these questions are almost always completed with a process of elimination approach.","String concatenation because that's what I learned first and I'm not very familiar with interpolation. To me, concatenation is more straightforward and easier to spot any mistakes.","Because I was familiar with string concatenation and I have seen similar questions like that before, I'd rather choose concatenation over interpolation. I've seen these kinds of questions on exams I've taken in CS 202 and CS 135, and even on the AP computer science exam in high school.","I noticed some of the questions included parenthesis with the braces (for example, ""({a}, {b})"" + ""({c})""), which made me look carefully as to which one is which. Maybe it would be nice to bold the braces for interpolation, but that's probably just apart of the question design to trick the reader."
