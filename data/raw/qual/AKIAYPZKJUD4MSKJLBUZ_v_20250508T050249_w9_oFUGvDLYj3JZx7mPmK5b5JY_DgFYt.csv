Interpolation made it very clear where whitespace is preserved, even though it might be slightly more verbose. On the other hand, usages of interpolation where ""{a} {b}"" leads to ""a b"" rather than `a` and `b` being interpreted as variables were unclear/difficult to parse.","There were many times where concatenation used literals in an unexpected way. For example, `""(0 1) "" + 4 + ... + m` is confusing because I expect `m` to be a variable, not interpreted as text, because I do not expect `...` to be interpreted as text, and because I do not expect that to preserve whitespace. If the desired result is ""(0 1) 4 + ... + m"", I would expect that to be written ""(0 1) "" + 4 + "" ... "" + ""m"" with concatenation.","Interpolation, because as I mentioned in question 1, the result is more predictable with less mental overhead.","Probably a lot! I have experience with string interpolation and concatenation in Python and Ruby primarily, but also Bash, fish, Java, C#... Ruby has by far my favorite syntax, followed by Python. In all of these, unquoted text is never interpreted as a literal, so that heavily flavors my understanding of your syntax.",Pay attention to consistency of literal representation and preservation of whitespace.
