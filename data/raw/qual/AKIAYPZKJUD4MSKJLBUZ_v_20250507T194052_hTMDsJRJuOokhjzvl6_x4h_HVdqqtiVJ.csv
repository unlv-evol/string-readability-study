0,c3c212d0,"I found the concatenation more readable. Especially regarding questions involving quotation marks, it was a little difficult because I assumed some things were strings while others were integers, when they were actually all strings. Interpolation just added to that confusion.","Not really, it did take a little time to figure out what the outputs were trying to say about the code snippet itself, again because some answers were just making everything a string even without quotation marks.","Nothing specific influenced my decision, I am just more used to concatenation and don't do a lot of programming involving printing strings outside of debugging.","I have learned both concatenation and interpolation, but never really used either. Concatenation is just easier to read and understand, but my prior experience didn't really impact this study for me.","Again, just being specific with what is and is not a string in the output is important, If a number doesn't have quotations I will assume it is an integer, but then all the answers make it seem like it was always a string."
