0,05ceae52,"I prefer using the '+' string concatenation. I think the interpolation looks nicer syntax-wise, but the one that makes the most sense to me in terms of reading and understanding is the basic string concatenation. For example "" {1} {2}"" and 1 + 2, would sometimes confuse me in a string because the {1} {2} feels like it should be another variable","Yes, I think it took me a bit longer to read and understand using interpolation. Especially with other brackets, it became difficult to read.","I would choose string concatenation. I feel that the simpler it looks, as long as I understand when I'm working with strings versus integers or numbers, it is really simple to read.","Since I am so used to string concatenation already, this may make my opinion biased on interpolation, as I barely used nor was taught it. But, string concatenation made the most sense to me logically.","I think the simplicity of string concatenation makes it intuitive and easy to understand. I don't know if either could necessarily be ""improved"" as both have their advantages and disadvantages, which is all up to preference in its usage."
