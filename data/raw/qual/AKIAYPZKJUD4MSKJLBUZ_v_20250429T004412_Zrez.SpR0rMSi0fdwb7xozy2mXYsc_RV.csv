0,4278b074,I found reading string concatenation to be more readable because brackets could be misleading sometimes. With string concatenation I was able to read it easily.,I noticed reading string concatenation was quicker and more efficient.,I would choose string concatenation because the readability is easier and much more easier to understand.,"Seeing adding like ""Hello"" + ""World"" = HelloWorld makes a lot more sense because of the addition sign.",I suggest emphasizing more on variables and what they mean.
