0,33345412,i was taught using interpolation so that one,Yea concatenation was weird until i picked it up towards the end atleast i feel like i did,interpolation again just the one i was taught,ive mainly used interpolation but its still a bit weird to understand i think it was just looking at the text/code something wasnt clicking for me in either of them,"none that i can think other than i think there only needs to be one or the other, having more than one option is nice but can also confuse people and cause issues"
