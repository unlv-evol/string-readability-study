0,1c6866d8,"I prefer string interpolation rather than string concatenation. I found string interpolation more reasonable, as various languages handle string concatenation differently. For example, in JavaScript, it will type coerce numbers into strings and perform other abnormal operations. This prior experience hindered my understanding of reading string concatenation. However, string interpolation does not provide that ambiguity.","String interpolation improved my ability to understand code snippets while concatenation hindered it quickly. String concatenation's use of the + operator can be interpreted differently depending on the language and can be ambiguous. String interpolation provides no ambiguity due to the + operator. However, string interpolation of constants was confusing. I had never used string interpolation to parse through integer literals (e.g. "" {1} {2}"") so it was confusing to grasp the new use case.","I would choose string interpolation because of it is easier to refactor, less prone to error, and readability. It is easier to add a new variable into the string since there is no need to use the + operator and a new pair of quotation marks. It is less prone to error since it can be easy to miss a set of quotation marks in a large string. It is more readable as there is no extra symbols obfuscating the string.",My previous experience with string interpolation helped me understand the string interpolated strings better as it was my preferred way. My previous experience of concatenation hindered me as it was my unpreferred way and the + operator can be confusing.,"String concatenation should use a different operator than the + operator. The + operator should be reserved for arithmetic operations. Therefore, a different operator should be chosen. For example, in PHP, string concatenation is used with the . operator. (i.e. str = ""My name is "" . $name . ""!""). This will clear up any ambiguity related to the + operator and type coercion."
