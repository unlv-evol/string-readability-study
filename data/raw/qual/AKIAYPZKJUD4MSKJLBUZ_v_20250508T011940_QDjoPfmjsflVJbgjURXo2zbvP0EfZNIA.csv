0,7d707980,I found string concatenation more readable because it is a simpler process than interpolation.,"The syntax for interpolation did not seem very clear. In many of the interpolation tasks, I felt like I was guessing at what the correct answer would be whereas for the concatenation tasks, it was easy to just see how two strings would join together.",I would use concatenation because it is conceptually simpler and I have prior experience with it.,I have used concatenation before but have never used interpolation. This made it easier for me to understand the concatenation tasks than the interpolation ones.,"Concatenation makes it easier to see where a literal string ends and a variable begins. With interpolation, it becomes much more difficult to see that distinction which results in less readable code. Interpolation honestly seems to me to be a solution in search of a problem so I'm not sure what improvements I could propose for it."
