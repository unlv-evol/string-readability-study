Being able to see what was clearly in the {} made it more readable for me","Yes, it definitely helped better understanding the code snippets, especially once I started to recognize it better. It was challenging in that it was hard to be sure sometimes what exactly was going on because it seemed intimidating at times with how things were written out.","I would choose interpolation, because to my eye it is more readable and easier to make sense of what it will print out as opposed to concatenation which confused me with what might be the correct result","Its hard to say, but I had more experience with concatenation prior due to me having used it more for coding assignment at my university, but overall once I understood interpolation better it made me prefer that for the readability","Potentially doing more ""human"" related examples, as opposed to what looks like random strings"
