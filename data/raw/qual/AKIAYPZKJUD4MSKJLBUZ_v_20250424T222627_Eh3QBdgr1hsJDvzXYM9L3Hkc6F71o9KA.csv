0,61398d75,"I found interpolation to be more readable because the string fits more snugly into the line of code. For example, when writing a string such as ""https://example.com/"", I find it much more intuitive to have the domain be interpolated inside the string like ""https://{domain}/"" rather than inserting it with the concatenation like ""https://"" + domain + ""/"" and having those nasty plus signs.","If you stick with one of the two to write a string, I feel it's rather straightforward to find out what the result is going to be, but using them both at the same time is the most challenging, since you need to wrap your brain around how both of them are going to fit and make up the final string.",I would definitely choose string interpolation for the more streamlined look and feel when writing up code.,"Having experience with both interpolation and concatenation, I already knew that I prefer interpolation, since I do tend to use it most of the time when I am writing code.","It would be best to maintain consistency between any code that you are writing, and if you are able to fit a resultant string into a smaller space, then I feel that would be most beneficial to the reader."
