0,d9c45e01,"I like concatenation a lot more since the plus signs just make it way more clear. Like I can clearly tell what part is being added compared to interpolation. Plus I am used to plus signs as opposed to brackets so I felt more comfortable reading those, ",Yes it was much harder readbility wise when there was a bunch of string concatenation and interpolation involved in a code snippet on top of literal strings. It was harder to see which one was which. ,"Concatenation because I can tell what I am combining in the string with plus signs. It's quite readable too because interpolation makes me think I am extracting something not inputting a string, if that makes sense.","Like I said concatenation is much clearer for me since I am used to using plus signs as opposed to brackets for adding strings. It makes more sense in readability as well so personally, I prefer it.",No not really.
