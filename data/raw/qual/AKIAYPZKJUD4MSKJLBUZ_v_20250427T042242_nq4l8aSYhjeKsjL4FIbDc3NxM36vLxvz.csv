0,bd8d6ce0,I feal that interpolation was more readable because I could easily fill in the blanks.,I had to keep checking the variables when it came to concatenation which slowed me down.,In future programming tasks I would prefer interpolation because there's less to keep track of.,It help me understand what the purpose of those code snippets did and how it is suppose to work.,One idea would be to find some way to space out the operators so that way it doesn't seem like a pile of text.
