0,dda1bb6a,For me concatenation was more readable but interpolation looks neater. I think concatenation was more readable only because its what I'm used to. I never really used interpolation when I was taught.,Interpolation made me a little more confused on where spaces were supposed to be in the whole string.,I would prefer interpolation since it looks cleaner to me and more interesting than concatenation.,I know concatenation more than interpolation so I felt easier to answer the concatenation questions.,No
