Interpolation,Explicit pieces,Piecewise clarity; components are visibly separated for readability.,Emphasizes clarity of separate parts or '+' being clearer.,If the point is speed/cognitive effort without parts clarity.,I found that is was more clear and I didn't have to think as hard.,29b8cfa1,4
Interpolation,IDE support,Editor highlighting/formatting aids readability.,Mentions IDE highlighting/formatting.,If tooling is not referenced.,"For example- print(f""Hello {name}, sup?"") Many editors like VS Code would highlight ""{name}"" in a different color, making it more intuitive to understand that it's a variable to be plugged",282be7cd,1
Interpolation,Less boilerplate,"Fewer tokens/joins; shorter, more concise expression.",Notes verbosity or many '+' characters.,If the text is about error risk only.,"Interpolation made it very clear where whitespace is preserved, even though it might be slightly more verbose.",4ee32703,1
Concatenation,Clearer syntax,Simpler or more recognizable placeholder markers/syntax.,Refers to simpler/braces/markers as clearer.,If clarity refers only to IDE coloring.,I find string concatenation more readable because it naturally causes a separation between parts of the string using the + symbol and spaces.,4b1edce7,2
Concatenation,Explicit pieces,Piecewise clarity; components are visibly separated for readability.,Emphasizes clarity of separate parts or '+' being clearer.,If the point is speed/cognitive effort without parts clarity.,"This is because of the ""+"" sign making it more clear for me to read quickly.",f02cbfc4,2
Concatenation,Faster at a glance,Readable at first glance without detailed parsing.,Mentions quick/at-a-glance readability.,"If timing refers to debugging, not reading.",I found string concatenation more readable as I found hat I was able to piece together the pieces faster.,eaf5fb5e,1
Concatenation,Natural flow,Sentence-like flow that reads naturally without mental reordering.,Describes sentence-like or fluent reading.,"If claim is about traceability, not flow.","To compound, the idea of addition is also more natural than substitution when combining literals together - for me at least.",dabbc80c,2
Both/Context Dependent,Clearer syntax,Simpler or more recognizable placeholder markers/syntax.,Refers to simpler/braces/markers as clearer.,If clarity refers only to IDE coloring.,"When using the + symbol, I would often find myself confusing it with addition.",2f8ffb2c,6
Both/Context Dependent,Context dependent,Readability preference varies with length/complexity.,States 'depends' with conditions.,If a clear preference is stated.,"However, interpolation seems like it would make for more readable code in the more meaningful context.",ab804763,2
Both/Context Dependent,Explicit pieces,Piecewise clarity; components are visibly separated for readability.,Emphasizes clarity of separate parts or '+' being clearer.,If the point is speed/cognitive effort without parts clarity.,"I felt that string interpolation was more readable because when reading a string, it was much clearer that the curly brackets were not part of the string.",5c429f4f,4
Both/Context Dependent,Faster at a glance,Readable at first glance without detailed parsing.,Mentions quick/at-a-glance readability.,"If timing refers to debugging, not reading.","concatenation, I am not familiar with interpolation but inferred what I could however if I was familiar, the flow of something like {a}{b}{c} is much faster to understand than a+b+c",134c2b79,4
Both/Context Dependent,Fewer clutter,"Reduced visual noise compared to '+' concatenation; cleaner, more compact lines.",Mentions clean/compact/less clutter vs '+'.,If only speed or debugging is discussed.,"Interpolation reduces the visual clutter of multiple + operators and quotes, especially in longer strings.",228f5b94,3
Both/Context Dependent,IDE support,Editor highlighting/formatting aids readability.,Mentions IDE highlighting/formatting.,If tooling is not referenced.,With concatenation there is always a pause in the string and this makes it harder to understand how the formatting of the string is written.,58b12dbc,1
Both/Context Dependent,Natural flow,Sentence-like flow that reads naturally without mental reordering.,Describes sentence-like or fluent reading.,"If claim is about traceability, not flow.",It was easier to logically place into the sentence and visualize it.,68e97c99,12
Both/Context Dependent,Too verbose,Perceived wordiness or excessive length that hinders readability.,Calls one form wordy/lengthy to read.,"If verbosity refers to writing, not reading.","What I mean is it was hard to read concatenation when it was just seemingly random letters/numbers, but when it was within the URLs it made a lot more sense",ab804763,1
None,Clearer syntax,Simpler or more recognizable placeholder markers/syntax.,Refers to simpler/braces/markers as clearer.,If clarity refers only to IDE coloring.,"the one using ""+"" and {} symbol",72eba1f0,1
None,Explicit pieces,Piecewise clarity; components are visibly separated for readability.,Emphasizes clarity of separate parts or '+' being clearer.,If the point is speed/cognitive effort without parts clarity.,"Interpoation was more readable to me because the layout was more clear and less ""business"" in the overall texts.",c94c001b,2
None,Too verbose,Perceived wordiness or excessive length that hinders readability.,Calls one form wordy/lengthy to read.,"If verbosity refers to writing, not reading.","The ones without the brackets felt more readable, but at times both versions felt hard to read or understand, especially because some of it was misspelt so it didn't match",5df1fa9d,1
