0,3c59878e,I think most of the time I found concatenation more readable when just mashing strings together. But for something like a filepath or url (which has a common structure) interpolation was more readable for me.,"Yeah, for something like the URL using interpolation, i feel like it was a lot easier to understand quickly. Like I said in my other response, I think its easier to understand a string with designated and varying spots (like the domain and query section).","I think for smaller or simpler things I might stick to concatenation. But for bigger strings that might require more variables that also are very different from time to time, I think I might prefere interpolation. 
Interpolation is definitely a lot clearer, especially when the variables have meaningful names. But sometimes it just feels like too much when i want to mash 2 strings together quickly.","Most of my programming career iv'e used and seem mostly concatenations, so it looked more familiar at first. But the examples with interpolation weren't too difficult to understand.","It was my understanding that interpolation is usually used with variables that are already defined, but it looked like in some of the questions that an interpolation like {1 (2)} would literally put ""1 (2)"" in the string. Not sure if this is the case, but if so it can be kinda confusing to someone who has little experience with it."
