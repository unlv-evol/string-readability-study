I'm relatively new to string interpolation, so I got somewhat confused when the interpolation brackets would be inside quotes for one question, then outside for another.","The concatenation operator '+' was much more straightforward and readable for me, so I'd say I had an easier time answering the concatenation questions.","I would choose string concatenation, because the idea of combining strings is much more straightforward for me.","I'm much more familiar with string concatenation while string interpolation is somewhat new to me, so in general the string interpolation questions did throw me off a little, especially distinguishing the difference between the brackets being inside and outside of quotes.","I don't really have any suggestions or recommendations, but I can say the interpolation brackets would be much more readable for me if they were color-graded like in IDEs, and that the '+' operator for string concatenation worked well for me."
