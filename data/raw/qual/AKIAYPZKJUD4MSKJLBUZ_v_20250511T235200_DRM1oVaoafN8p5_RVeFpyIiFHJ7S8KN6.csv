0,7169cddd,Concatenation mostly because it's what I'm most used to. ,Concatenation made it easier for me to understand code snippets. I had trouble with examples where interpolation symbols were many and close together. The addition of the plus sign in concatenation lets me more clearly understand things like spacing and the exact thing being concatenated.,"I would use string concatenation, again, because it's what I'm used to.","I understood concatenation better, again because it's what I'm used to.",better spacing in interpolation?
