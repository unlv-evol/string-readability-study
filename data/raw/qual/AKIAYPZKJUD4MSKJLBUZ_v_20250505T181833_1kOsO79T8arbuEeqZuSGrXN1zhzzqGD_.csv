0,40c4c097,string interpolation is more readable. You don't need to be checking if there are quotes around it because as soon as you see {} you knew that it was referring to a variable. ,It took more a second to get use to string interpolation but once you understand it I found it easier to read. ,I would personally use string concatenation. I think it's easier to understand it. When there are quotes around it will display exactly what is in the quotes but when there are no quotes you need to see what variable it is.  ,string interpolation was more confusing to understand because I have not seen that before. String concatenation is what I am use to. ,
