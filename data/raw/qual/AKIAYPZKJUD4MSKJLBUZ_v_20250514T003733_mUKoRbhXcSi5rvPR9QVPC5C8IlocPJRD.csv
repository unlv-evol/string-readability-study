0,8eae4fa2,Concatenation was easier to read as it was building off of something that I am already familiar with.,interpolation was quicker to debug as if you have the {} in the output statement or if there were other formatting errors it was easier to see where in the code that happened.,I would use concatenation because it required less keyboard inputs and it would be the option I would better understand what it is capable of. ,"Yes as I have used concatenation before, albeit not often. It allowed me to quickly understand how it would work. On the other hand I have never used interpolation in this way before.",Have the variable name change colors when used with either interpolation or concatenation.
