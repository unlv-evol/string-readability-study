",Interpolation took a little longer than concatenation but it wasn't that hard and didn't take too long. ,I would prefer concatenation because it is easier to put strings together with the + instead of having to figure out what was inserted using the {}. ,Prior experiences helped my understanding because I already knew how concatenation worked so that made it easier to put strings together. ,I dont really have any suggestions for improvement because these are fairly basic concepts of strings which are easy to use and understand.
