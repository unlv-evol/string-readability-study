0,6985aac2,I find string concatenation more readable because it doesn't seem as cluttered.,"No, I found that my understanding and debugging of code remained the same either way. I understood each question, and it was presented clearly throughout the study.",I would prefer string concatenation due to its easy readability and efficiency. I find it a little more time-consuming to write string interpolation.,"I have used string concatenation more than string interpolation, and I was able to recognize and answer the concatenation questions faster than the string interpolation questions.","I think the readability and comprehension are good, the only thing I recommend is fixing a typo I noticed with the John Doe questions."
