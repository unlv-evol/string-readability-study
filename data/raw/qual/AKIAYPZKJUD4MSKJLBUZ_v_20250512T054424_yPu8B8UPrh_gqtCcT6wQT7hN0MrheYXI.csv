0,acff7b20,I would say string interpolation is more readable especially when the level of complexity increased.,"Yes, it helps with what the expected output will look like and how each variable represent themselves.","I would choose string interpolation due to being easier of readability,  and compared to concatenation seems to be easier to update or reorder the variable.",At first it was simple and intuitive but than more variables and number were making it complex but with the provided code examples I feel much faster at reading the code and understanding it intuitively.,Encourage multiline support when using multiple lines of interpolation and for readability color coded variables could be more clearer form of syntax
