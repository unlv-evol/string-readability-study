0,8b76407b,The string concatenation was more readable because the + is more visually distinct than curly brackets. I tended to mix up the curly brackets with parentheses which made it slightly harder to understand the scope of either.,"Concatenation is generally easier to for me to understand and debug since the + sign is so visually distinctive. The only issue I have with using the + sign is forgetting spaces at the beginning or end of strings. Interpolation can help me visualize how certain strings will be incorporated into the middle of larger strings, but I don't prefer it. The only challenge arises when I want to print plus signs or curly brackets. It can get confusing to identify when they are being used in the string or when they are being used to interpolate or concatenate.","I would prefer string concatenation because it's easier to visualize what the final string will look like. Interpolation's use of brackets causes potential confusion regarding scope and what string contents will actually be printed, and what is part of interpolation's syntax.","I prefer to use concatenation/am more familiar with it, so it's ease of use appealed to me. I also tend to think of it as more intuitive. I chose to avoid overuse of brackets since it's difficult to understand scope at a glance if the string becomes complex.","This is mostly applicable to use in IDEs, but color coding would be helpful to determine scope. I think the use of curly brackets is good though, because it's less common in mathematical functions and visually makes me think of strings more than math. Still, I prefer concatenation. Although I occasionally get confused whether ""+"" is being used for math or concatenation, the use of quotation marks usually makes it easier for me to tell at a glance."
