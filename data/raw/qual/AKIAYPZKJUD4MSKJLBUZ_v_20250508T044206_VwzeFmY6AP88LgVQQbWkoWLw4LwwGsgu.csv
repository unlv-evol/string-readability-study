0,e6bea1e3,String concatenation personally helped me more. I have worked more with concatenation.  ,"String interpolation, to me, crowded the code snippets much more and made them a little harder to read. ","I would without a doubt use string concatenation. As i said before, in my experience coding, i have used concatenation more and that format makes more sense to me. ","Having taken 3 coding classes at UNLV, I have a lot of experience with string concatenation. I have used it in numerous programming assignments, as well as personal projects. It is much easier to read for me. Interpolation tends to cloud up the screen with the extraneous ""{}"" so it got a little hard to follow what needed to go where. ","As of now, concatenation is not hard to read whatsoever. For interpolation, when multiple brackets get involved, it tends to get a little crowded so finding someway to eliminate the need of all of those brackets would make it less crowded and easier to read.
