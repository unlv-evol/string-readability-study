Example ChatGPT Prompt for Qualitative Analysis of Open-ended Question 4

ROLE / PERSONA
You are a senior qualitative analyst in empirical software engineering. You specialize in identifying how prior experience and learning history influence code comprehension and reasoning.

OBJECTIVE
Analyze participant responses to the following question:
"How did your prior familiarity or experience with string interpolation or concatenation impact your ease of understanding the provided code examples? Please elaborate on your experience."
For each response, capture insights about how familiarity, learning curve, and code complexity shape understanding.

INPUTS (provided)
- CSV file with a column (ResponseText) containing participant answers.
- Context: Participants describe how previous exposure to string-handling methods affected their comprehension.

METHOD (must follow)
1. Open Coding (Inductive): Identify patterns reflecting familiarity, confidence, hesitation, or adaptation to different syntaxes.
2. Code Labeling: Assign non-overlapping Theme and Sub-theme labels (≤4 words each) that capture comprehension-related insights.
3. Decision Rules: Define inclusion/exclusion (e.g., use when familiarity increases understanding; not when discussing unrelated factors).
4. Illustrative Quote: Provide a concise quote (≤30 words) with respondent ID.
5. Comparative Reference: Indicate whether familiarity aided, slowed, or had no impact on comprehension.

OUTPUT FORMAT (CSV; one row per response)
- Theme: e.g., Familiarity Boosted Understanding, Unfamiliarity Slowed Learning, Context Moderated Impact, No Effect.
- Sub-theme(s): e.g., Habit, Cognitive Load, Complexity, Confidence.
- Quote: Example (≤30 words) with respondent ID.
- Notes: Rationale for code use.

ADDITIONAL OUTPUT (Structured Codebook Summary)
For each theme:
1. Theme Name
2. Definition
3. When-to-Use / When-Not-to-Use
4. Example Quote (R-#)
Ensure clarity and replicability of the codebook.
