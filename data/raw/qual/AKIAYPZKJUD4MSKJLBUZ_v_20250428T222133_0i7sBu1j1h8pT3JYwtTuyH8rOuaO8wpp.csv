0,edf34f86,"I think concatenation was easier, but that's also because I'm used to reading it like that and so I understood the moment I read it. Not to say that interpolation wasn't helpful in certain cases. When it was longer string like the web link example, that was definitely easier to read what it wanted to print out. When you're adding in more brackets into math problems that definitely made me slow down thinking about what the string was supposed to be. ","I think the challenge will always be double checking what the variable name is referring to. Either method, I was double checking the answer because I wanted to make sure a = hello and b = world. An advantage would once you figure out what the variables meant, and you saw the interpolation then it was ""OH I see what you wanna say"". So in that case, I think interpolation was able to speed my reading up. ","Depending on what I was writing out, either could work. If it was a website link or a long paragraph where you had key words being replaced, I would do interpolation since I think it's more appealing and eliminate any confusion with random '+'. To be honest, anytime I see variable + variable and it's related to strings it always confuses me for a minute, so with the interpolation after I figured out what it is, it made it definitely easier to replace the words. However, math equations I wouldn't use the interpolation because my eyes would confuse the brackets and parentheses. ","Had no idea what interpolation was so it took me a minute to understand what it wanted to convey. Concatenation I have seen before, but I always forget how the strings actually go together. So, seeing the examples I needed a few seconds to figure out the spacing and what was and was not included in the outputs. With the math equations it take a bit long than actual worded strings. ",I would not have any suggestions how to enhance it. Each has its ups and downs. It was definitely easier to understand when the variables were actually worded than when it was a single letter.
