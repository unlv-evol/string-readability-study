0,c852a332,"String concatenation is more readable because it has a different look than parentheses, which look very similar to the brackets used for interpolation. However, when it comes to inserting a value, interpolation is easier (like when it says x = okay and the example says ""{x} is this"") to UNDERSTAND over concatenation.","Yeah the string interpolation when there were many parentheses affected my ability to QUICKLY understand what was happening. The concatenation was definitely a bit easier.
","I like the elegance behind string interpolation but because I am so used to string concatenation, I think I would continue to use it for now.
","My prior familiarity with string concatenation made it easier to understand the examples, I'm sure if I used interpolation more often (HTML etc) then this would be easier to look at and understand quicker.","A color change for each new set of brackets / parenthesis would make things super easy, but not sure how feasible that is."
