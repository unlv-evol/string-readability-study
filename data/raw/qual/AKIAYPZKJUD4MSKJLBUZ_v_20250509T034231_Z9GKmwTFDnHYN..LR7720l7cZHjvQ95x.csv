0,073e928f,"I think interpolation was more readable than concatenation. While both required the variable's name being included in the code for output, interpolation allows me to see exactly where that variable's value will be in the output without plus signs masking it. ",The use of string interpolation and concatenation not inside of parentheses and/or with numbers instead of variable names confused me. I am not familiar with it so I had no idea what kind of output it would give so I would not know how to debug it.,"I would prefer interpolation since I think it looks more readable, and I know where the variable's value will go. However, if I were including actual numbers in my output not under quotations like in some of the problems, I would prefer concatenation since it looks closer to math.","I have experience with concatenation but none with interpolation. This made it a little difficult to understand what interpolation meant at first, but from the exercises, I believe it is used to directly replace a variable name with its value in the output? I think that not having this knowledge beforehand helped me make a less biased judgment about its uses.",None that I can think of.
