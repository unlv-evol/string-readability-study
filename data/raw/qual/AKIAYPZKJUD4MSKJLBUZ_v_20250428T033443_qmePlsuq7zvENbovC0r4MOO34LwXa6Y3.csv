0,be803b04,"Concatenation was more readable to me as it clearly defined exactly what is a word and what is a variable. Example: ""Hello "" + World, I can clearly tell world is a variable at first glance where ""Hello {World}"" is tougher to tell on first glance.","Yes, as whether or not I am able to quickly interpret what I am reading is better so I don't get confused and end up debugging the wrong thing.","I would choose concatenation as it is much easier to write and read for me, and though it makes statements longer is improves readability a lot. I also believe using a + sign makes much more sense to append to a string rather than {}.",I am much more familiar with concatenation so I suppose it made it much easier for me to understand them. I am also used to math so a + symbol was more familiar to me.,"I think interpolation could use a bit more denotation to show it is a variable, for example ""Hello {{World}}"" makes it much more clear, though it might be harder to write."
