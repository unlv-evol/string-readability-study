0,085c8085,"I personally find string concatenation to be easier to read. I think this is mostly due to it having less visual clutter. The curly braces used in interpolation in this case can conflict with the contents of the string. This can lead to them being harder to distinguish. This is not to say that it does not come with any downsides however. I personally find it easier to write code that includes string interpolation, even if I do find it harder to read after the fact, and it is much easier to make spacing mistakes with concatenation.","As described before, I find the added braces used in interpolation interfere with my ability to quickly resolve text that already contains braces on its own.","For me, it depends on the length of the string(s). For short strings, the inconvenience of concatenation is no big deal compared to the low complexity and ease of reading. For longer strings however (especially if variables are reused) I find it to be significantly easier to write code using interpolation.",I think my prior familiarity helped especially with understanding the string interpolation snippets. ,"I don't have any specific suggestions. However, I think it's important to note that for me, regardless of if we're using interpolation or concatenation, the most important factor in readability is preservation of order and clear naming of variables.
