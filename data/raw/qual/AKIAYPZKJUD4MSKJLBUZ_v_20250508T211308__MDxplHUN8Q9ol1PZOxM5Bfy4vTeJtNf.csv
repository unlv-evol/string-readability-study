0,0ff7d49a,"I would say string concatenation because if there was a string variable you could add it in between strings, which would mean you wouldn't stop to check so often of what the string variable holds if it were string interpolation such as "" Hello"" + world, compared to ""Hello {world}"" where world = ""World"". This is an easy example but once strings get more larger or complicated, multiple concatenations stops you from having to keep track of what variables are in the string.","Yes, because I have only used or remembered using string concatenation before, so it made it easier to understand string concatenation while I had to quickly gain an understanding of string interpolation.","I would prefer string concatenation because it is more math focused, and due to CS being a more math leaning major, it helps a lot more. Also because of output lines in assignments, it makes more sense to use it; for example, an output line would be something like this: cout<<""Hello""<<world<<endl; . Another factor is I usually associate {} with code blocks.","Experience with string concatenation helped me understand the code examples. One of them was ""a = "" a ... ""d = "" d. This made a lot of sense since it has something I've been learning along the lines.",none
