It just seems a little easier to know what it will output, maybe it might be because I'm used to working with string concatenation.",Interpolation affected me a little but only when it came to the parentheses. It just looked odd and it just took me a little longer to debug.,I think I would use interpolation even though I did say it was a bit more difficult to read because it makes code look cleaner and line length shorter.,"I have more experience with concatenation which made it much easier to read. Interpolation was just not familiar to me since I usually code in C++, I use more concatenation than anything.","Not really, I feel like they are both as good as they can be it just takes a second to get used to."
