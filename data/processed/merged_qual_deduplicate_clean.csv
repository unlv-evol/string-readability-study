4108241f,R-1,"I found string interpolation more readable overall. It reduces visual noise by embedding variables directly into the string, avoiding repetitive "" + var + "" patterns. For example, f""Hello {name}"" is clearer and more concise than ""Hello "" + name. It makes it easier to understand the intended output at a glance, especially when multiple variables are involved.","Yes — interpolation helped me understand the structure and meaning of the output faster. With concatenation, I had to mentally resolve the expression left to right, which can be error-prone if spacing or types aren't clear. Interpolation was more direct, and I didn’t have to worry about type conversion (e.g., numbers to strings) as much.","I’d choose interpolation for most tasks because it improves readability, reduces syntactic overhead, and often prevents bugs related to spacing or type coercion. It's especially useful in logging, UI templates, and formatted output. Concatenation might still be useful in dynamic, loop-based constructions, but for clarity, interpolation wins.","My prior experience with both techniques helped me immediately recognize what the expressions were trying to do. I’m familiar with Python, JavaScript, and Java, so switching between + and {} representations was intuitive. That said, less experienced users might struggle with syntax-specific interpolation unless it closely resembles what they know.","One improvement would be to enforce or recommend consistent spacing and formatting guidelines, especially in concatenation-heavy code. For interpolation, clearer delimiters (e.g., distinguishing between variables and functions) might help in complex cases.

I believe `{}` should be the de facto standard to use any form of interpolation and anything inside of it should be treated as non-String types until the runtime system needs to convert the value into a string. For concatenation, I would suggest considering a C-like approach with how values replace variables inside of strings as seen in `printf`.

Also, tools that highlight interpolated variables differently in code editors (similar to syntax highlighting) could help with comprehension.

Some of the examples in this survey included concatenations like (1+1+1+1) and it took me a few seconds to not read this as arithmetic but as string concatenation. With string interpolation, the strings themselves are defined as variables that are simply (visually simple to understand) inserted into strings like {string}, and it just makes it easier to read because the ""{ }"" can't be confused with other common symbols, like + for addition. Also, the ""{ }"" look like dividers which more clearly show where the string is being inserted. Concatenation doesn't have clearly visible barriers, unlike ""{ }"", so I also got confused with seeing where strings ended and started.","Yes. Understanding the code with interpolation was much simpler than concatenation. With concatenation, it took time for me to see where strings ended, where strings began, where with interpolation I can more clearly see this division as well as visually understand how & where strings are being inserted.","I've had to do assignments and projects in the past where regular concatenation, with +, was simpler, but overall I tend to prefer interpolation. I have a lot of experience with using string interpolation in my projects that influenced my decision. To be specific, I do a lot of work with web development with Vue.js, and I use {{example}} a lot for string interpolation into my ""html"". An example is <p>Cost: {{cost}}</p>. Alongside these projects, and other projects, I've used a lot of TypeScript and JavaScript, and for printing statements (like cout and printf) with string interpolation, you would write console.log(`hello ${examplemsg}`);. I use string interpolation like this frequently for printing errors, like console.log(`Error: ${err}`);. So in Vue.js/TS/JS you can use {{ }} or ${ }. I don't really find myself using string concatenation as often as I do with string interpolation. The most useful example that I remember for needing string concatenation was for a recursive function of a tree, and basically the function needed to return a string, representing the path to a node (a leaf node), formed by concatenating ""0""'s and ""1""'s, depending on left/right path, as the function went up the tree from a leaf node and back to the main caller. Besides that though I would generally chose string interpolation.","I use a lot of JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS) with the Vue.js frontend framework for web development. To print statements in JS and TS with variables, you write console.log(`Hello ${name}`);. In Vue.js's ""html"", I use a lot of string interpolation for displaying dynamic data, like <p>Cost: {{cost}}</p>. ""${ }"" and ""{{ }}"" are the main ways that I regularly use string interpolation, and I use string interpolation much more regularly than string concatenation (although I remember having to use something like <p>{{firstName+ lastName}}</p>, and in this case concatenation is useful when I have user's names split between first and last name). Overall, my regular use of string interpolation made it much more easier for me to understand the examples. I regularly use string interpolation in similar ways that the examples provide.","I think string concatenation is useful in some cases, with the two examples I provided being such cases. Overall though, unless the strings being concatenated aren't variables themselves, then in general it is easier to read code that uses string interpolation rather than string concatenation. Things like ""1""+""1""+""1""+""1"" can be confusing to read, but I feel like concatenation in examples like cout << firstName+ lastName << endl;, compared to string interpolation like cout << {firstName}{lastName } << endl;, are both fairly understandable to read (although I prefer the latter, and you could make it so adding a space w/ quotes like cout << ""{myName} {lastName }"" << endl; would generate a space in the console too).
