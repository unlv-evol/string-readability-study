0,870990fb,"I think string Interpolation is more readable because a {} would better let me think the process of embeddings, and I really don't like string concatenation because the '+' sign is misleading in string practices and it will mix the function with the actual arithmetic addition sign.","Not yet. I rarely use string concatenation to write my code, and string interpolation didn't cause any problem to debug code snippets.",I would prefer string interpolation. I chose interpolation because it won't mix with arithmetic addition and makes me understand I am not adding the number together. ,"My prior understanding of string concatenation is when I add two string numbers together it won't have space between, but after doing the provided code examples it seems automatically adding the space between. Or maybe my understanding is wrong. ","The string interpolation is easy to understand, but concatenation syntax needs to improve on its clarification when 2 + 1 and ""2"" + ""1"" occur."
