In the examples where there would be brackets and parentheses, I found it difficult to break down what was being concatenated and what was part of the notation. This confusion may also be because I lack familiarity with string interpolation methods.","As the questions included more convoluted code snippets, I found it challenging to follow along and see what was being combined during string interpolation. As I was trying to go through the questions fairly quickly, I began to struggle with breaking down what was happening especially looking back and forth between the options and the code snippet.","I would choose string concatenation for future programming tasks because I am more familiar with it and it was easier for me to understand. Especially in situations with braces and parentheses, the use of the '+' symbol makes it easier for me to understand and differentiate the code snippet.","Because I have prior experience using string concatenation from previous coding classes, I was able to understand those code snippets easier. Since I have never used string interpolation before, it was more difficult for me to understand the code examples.",I think having more spaces in the code snippet would help enhance the readability of the string interpolation syntax.
