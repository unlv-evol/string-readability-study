0,16398729,"The + was more readable for me, but I think its due to the fact that math has been a constant in my life since the age of 4 years old, so I know what + is meant to do in a variety of different contexts. While {} are new to me from the last 10ish years and even then I wasn't really sure what they were meant to do, I just knew I needed them or the code wouldn't work.","Yes, + definatly was much faster for me, the same reasoning I gave for question one applies here. As for my {} makes it harder, I feel like among many thing the biggest issue is that it blends into the text/code too well. The + stands out like a seporater combining information like ""A + B"" while {} doesn't bring anything solid to my mind at first glance, more like confusion for a moment or two.","I choose concatenation, given the reasons I've already provided in questions 1 and 2, the + symbol just makes it easier to understand and read since its such a big part of peoples educational lives from a young age.","Since I've already talked a lot about how familiarity has played in for me, I'll just give an example: ""A + B"" is intuative to me while {A} {B} is not.","Spaces would help a bit, but over all if you want the same familiarity as + then {} needs to be taught to kids from a young age to avoid confusion."
