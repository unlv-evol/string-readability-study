0,6400cbec,I found string concatenation to be easier to read as it is something that I have dealt with more.,"Using string interpolation slowed me down just a little bit. However, this was for the reason I said before, that I just have not used string interpolation as much.","I would definitely choose string concatenation, as it is something I have used more.","I have had prior experience with both, which did allow me to understand interpolation easier, as it isn't something I come across regularly anymore, but I have had far more experience with concatenation, allowing me to complete those examples just a bit more easier.","I feel like they both are fine in their readability and comprehension, its just that I am slightly biased towards concatenation as I have used it more."
