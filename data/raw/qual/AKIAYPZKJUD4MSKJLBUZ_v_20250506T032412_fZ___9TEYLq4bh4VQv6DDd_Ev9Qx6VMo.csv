0,35fa1d89,I found string interpolation more readable in most cases especially for the file and website paths as it closely matches the end result.,I found some trouble quickly deciphering some of the string interpolation as it felt tricky mentally removing the curly brackets and figuring out where they ended.,I would choose to use interpolation as it is more readable and would result in shorter lines to put together strings. With good variable names the interpolation syntax is very readable and easy to understand. There are cases where i would still use concatenation like if i was combining strings returned from functions.,I have essentially no experience with interpolation and so it took me a moment to understand how it worked during the practice section but I quickly picked it up and found it most of the time easier than concatenation.,"I can't think of an exact suggestion but i feel like the curly brackets might be better off being replaced by something else. Maybe single quotes ""Hello 'name'.""?"
