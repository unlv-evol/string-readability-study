0,c6c04cbf,"I found concatenation more readable. If there is pure concatenation, it's easier to follow the markers to know where the blocks are. With interpolation it's possible to figure out the blocks, but it just takes longer for me.","Yes. When they were used in combination, it became hard quickly. I was struggling to understand what was what exactly (especially because there was no color-coding).","I would use concatenation. One reason is that I have used mostly concatenation until now in my programming career, and so I'm more used to it. Another reason is that without color-coding, it looks better in my opinion.","I have had little exposure to interpolation, and so I felt it was harder for me to understand what was going on on the more complex questions. On the other hand, I felt that concatenation felt easier and more natural to me.","Color-coding is one of the most important aspects in this regard. With good color-coding, complex problems can be easier to understand. Aside from that, I would say that maybe use unique symbols for the markers of either concatenation or interpolation. The currently used markers may to be too common in other scenarios, reducing the readability of these features."
