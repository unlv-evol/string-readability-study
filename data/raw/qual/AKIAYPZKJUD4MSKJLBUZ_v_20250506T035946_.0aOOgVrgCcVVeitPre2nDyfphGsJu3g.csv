0,84b9be55,"String concatenation felt more readable. When I see the plus, I know the next thing is simply added to the previous thing. String interpolation was not as familiar to me as someone who primarily knows C++. My understanding of {} changed as I went through the questions and scanned answer choices and so my later answers might contradict my previous answers. For example, at one point I assumed curly braces inside quotations do not count as interpolation but just output as curly braces. However, none of the answer choices reflected that, so I had to change my assumptions.","Concatenation was easier for me to see from a high level and understand what is happening. String interpolation was more tricky, especially when surrounding or being surrounded by other symbols like parentheses, plus signs, or quotations.","I would choose string concatenation simply because it felt more natural to me. With C++ being my primary language, I haven't grown accustomed to interpolation due to lack of experience in other languages like Python or C#.","Knowing C++ only, I had trouble with interpolation due to C++ not having that quality built in. I was not sure how syntax would work when enveloping the curly braces inside quotations, or how to interpret expressions with parentheses like (0 1 2) inside of curly braces, etc.","For interpolation readability, it makes the most sense in my mind if anything inside quotes are exactly that. So if we want to evaluate certain expressions and embed them in the middle of a string, they should be put in between the first substring and the second substring, and not inside quotes. I don't mind whether the plus sign is there or not to signify concatenation. "
