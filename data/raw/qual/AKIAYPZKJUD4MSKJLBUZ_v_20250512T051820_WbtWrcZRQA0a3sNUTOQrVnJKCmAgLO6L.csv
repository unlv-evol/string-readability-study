0,810a820e,"String concatenation was more readable to me, because with the strings, I know that if I add a string which uses + to another string, it is just going to combine them together","Personally, concatenation was easier to grasp than interpolation. Because all I needed to do in order to add strings to each other was to just use an + symbol. I would also know exactly how many spaces I typed compared to interpolation because when surrounding a variable with (), I was unsure if it would add all the variables within the same () or not. I quickly realized they don't add to each other if in the same (), but it wasn't as straightforward as +. Also, don't know if this is much of an issue, but answers with the same options but spaced differently threw me off with interpolation.",String concatenation just because I was able to personally identify the answers faster.,"I believe I prefer concatenation because I haven't really used a programming language that uses interpolation. I mostly program in C++ for school which uses concatenation and was introduced to it in my first CS class when adding two strings together. I don't remember if I did practice with interpolation, but what I do remember is concatenation and if I did practice both, I must have preferred concatenation because of its easier readability for me.","Given my limited practice in programming, I do not think I can add any recommendations."
