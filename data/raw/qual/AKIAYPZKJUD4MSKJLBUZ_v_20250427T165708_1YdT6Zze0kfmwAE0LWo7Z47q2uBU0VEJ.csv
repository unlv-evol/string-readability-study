0,e41b6389,"If complexity isn't an issue, concatenation is easier. Still, it gets weird and hard to read just after a couple of elements/variables are introduced, so interpolation is more elegant and easier to understand overall.","I found string interpolation way easier to read and debug. It’s just cleaner since you can insert variables directly into the string. With concatenation, we have to deal with extra spaces, plus signs, and type conversions, which makes everything feel messier. Interpolation made it clear how the variables fit into the string, while concatenation sometimes led to formatting mistakes or just took longer to figure out.","String interpolation definitely, once you get the hang of it, it's pretty intuitive, and it reduces error possibility. With concatenations, it's like ""oh I forgot a space there"", ""oh that's not a variable"", etc etc. That isn't an issue with interpolation. It's also just way more elegant than typing out so many quotes and plus signs.","I have experience with both. Obviously, concatenation is one of the first things you learn when learning to program, so I definitely am more familiar with it. But with that being said, when codes got more complex, interpolation took way less time to figure out, just because of how lengthy the concatenations got.","The only thing I can think of off the top of my head is that we need some way to make concatenation more user-friendly, if that makes sense. It takes forever to type the quotes and plus signs, and that's why interpolation is so much better in the long run. Also, it gets pretty tacky when multiple variables are involved, so I'm not sure, but something could be done to make it easier to apply variables in concatenation."
