0,65046f3a,When the string was longer I had an easier time with interpolation but when they were shorter concatenation was easier to ring.,A bit especially when the strings got longer. with the last couple questions with the URL being harder to understand with concatenation. It was easy to understand the snippets when the brackets from the interpolation.,Most likely interpolation especially if I work with longer strings as it is easier to read. The brackets also just look neater than the plus and quotation marks riddled throughout the string.,I didn't have much familiarity with interpolation but concatenation was used a lot in the early computer science courses I took and that is why it was easier to read the first couple questions that had concatenation.,"I cant really think of anything, maybe find a way to make concatenation seem a bit more simpler and easier to read when working with longer strings."
