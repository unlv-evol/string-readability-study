0,23752ad4,concatination because it made sense logically if u have a + b and a = 1 and b = 2 and heyre strings it would just be 1 (space) 2.,Im pretty sure some asnwers were very similar just one had no quotations or the other had less spaces this made it hard to debug.,Concatination because it is easier to understand even if you don't know how to code. I think it looks straightforward to someone who has no programming experience.,I think we learned concatination in cs135 and that knowledge helped me in this sruvey.,Concatination is easier to follow
