0,346c1efe,String interpolation was easier because it put the variables in {} making it easier to see what was apart of the string and what was a variable.,"Using the interpolation made it easier to debug areas that were either spelt incorrectly, or missing certain aspects like a space or a comma.","I would chose interpolation, even though I am more used to using concatenation, the interpolation seemed much easier to read and even easier to write when you need to imagine what is going to be printed as you are typing.","I had no previous understanding of interpolation so it was more difficult to understand at first, but once I figured it out, it became the easier one to read. I have worked with concatenation before so it was not difficult to understand at the beginning, but I still found interpoaltion easier towards the end.",N\A
