This is because you can clearly see if there are spaces and whatnot. Also, since I use Python outside of class, it's what I'm comfortable with.",I faced challenges with the parentheses (). I wasn't sure if I should add it to the actual string or if it's just there to isolate values.,I prefer interpolation since it is easier for someone to visualize/see the full string quickly.,"I have experience with concatenation from classes at UNLV and interpolation from using Python at my internship. Even though I technically have more experience with C++ and concatenation, interpolation is much easier to use and understand.","It gets really hard to read when there's a combination of concatenation, interpolation, as well as parentheses. It would be better just to choose one method and stick with it, and I'd recommend that method be interpolation."
