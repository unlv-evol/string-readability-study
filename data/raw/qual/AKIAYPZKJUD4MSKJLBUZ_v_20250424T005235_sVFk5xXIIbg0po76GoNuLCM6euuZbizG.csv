0,5c429f4f,"I felt that string interpolation was more readable because when reading a string, it was much clearer that the curly brackets were not part of the string. While with concatenation, '+' could have been part of it, and it takes more time to read strings that use concatenation.
Example of String Concatenation that I feel would be difficult to read: a + "" + "" + b
Same example using String Interpolation: ""{a} + {b}""","String concatenation made it easier to quickly understand code snippets. Curly brackets are an uncommon set of characters to use in a string, making it easier to understand when they should be replaced with a variable. There was an example of a string that had variable names as part of the string but were not supposed to be replaced with the variables value (i.e. ""path"" instead of ""{path}""). String interpolation made it very easy to understand the difference.","I would rather use string interpolation. It felt easier to read and looked cleaner than string concatenation, especially when concatenating multiple strings/variables it becomes much more difficult to read.","I'm more accustomed to seeing string concatenation, it is what I usually use for combining strings or including variables in strings. I have recently started to move towards string interpolation for, but I feel that despite having more experience with string concatenation, I found string interpolation to be much easier to debug and understand.",I think replacing '+' with '&' may help with string concatenation readability; '&' stands out as a character more which can help make recognizing a string concatenation easier.
