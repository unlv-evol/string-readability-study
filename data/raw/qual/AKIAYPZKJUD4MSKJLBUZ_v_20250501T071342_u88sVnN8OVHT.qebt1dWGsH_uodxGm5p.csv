0,92796ef4,"String concatenation was more readable to me - because I'm just more familiar with it. String interpolation made sense since I'm used to `cout << ""string 1 "" + ""string 2"" << endl;` 
Perhaps if I'd learned JS I'd be more familiar with interpolation.","String concatenation took me a solid second to quickly understand and debug code snippets. Since I wasn't _too_ sure if it was able to nest or not, I sat there wondering if a nested concatenation would've been printed or not.","If I were FORCED into a choice, I'd choose string concatenation purely because I'm more familiar with it. I can substitute text as well as I could with string interpolation - and it makes more sense, mentally, at least.","String concatenation is simple: you take a variable, and you chuck it in. Depending on the programming language, it would be coerced into a string or char format.
String interpolation is also simple - I've seen it before... I just wasn't too sure if it included nesting or not.",null
