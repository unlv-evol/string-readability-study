0,4df959fe,The string concatenation was easier to read because the interpolation added extra characters that began to get confusing.,It caused me to overthink and spend too much time on certain aspects. Using the interpolation was more difficult to process through each task versus the concatenation.,I would choose concatenation because its simple compared to using interpolation.,I'm much more unfamiliar with interpolation in programming compared to using concatenation.,"Since I've only participated in a few programming courses, I find I don't have any ideas on how to improve it since I'm still becoming familiar with VS Code and using c++ compilers.
