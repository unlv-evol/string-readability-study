0,fb5ddfab,"I felt like the string concatenation was slightly more readable than the string interpolation in most cases. During cases where more parenthesis and curly brackets were used, it was difficult to determine at a glance how interpolation would interact with the parenthesis. However, those questions felt easier to understand with the string concatenation.","I felt like some of the longer code snippets overall felt difficult to quickly understand and debug, regardless of using string interpolation or concatenation. I did feel like the shorter code snippets were easier to debug with string concatenation, but it was easy to debug using either method.","I do think I would still use string interpolation, only because it is way easier to type out. String interpolation is more versatile and allows for quicker access of variables while not needing to close double quotes, while string concatenation has the only benefit of being a little more readable. With an IDE, I do think string interpolation would be way better too, as the colors set for the programming language would make it way easier to read interpolation.","I have used both string interpolation and string concatenation, but not a whole lot. It made me familiar with both, but some of the more obscure uses, such as its relationship with parenthesis, were a bit more confusing.",I have no suggestions
