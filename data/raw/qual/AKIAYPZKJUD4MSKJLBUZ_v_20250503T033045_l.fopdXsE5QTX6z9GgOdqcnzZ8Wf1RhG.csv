0,ca37d68f,"I found string interpolation more readable because it looks cleaner and feels like natural language. For example, 'Hello, ${name}' is easier than ""Hello, "" + name.","Yes, string interpolation helped me understand code faster since everything is in one place, but there were long expressions inside the string. Therefore, it was a little harder to debug.","I prefer string interpolation because it is shorter, easier to read, and has less chance of missing a character (space or quote). ","I have used both ways in the past. Lately, I use interpolation more often. I have been working on websites for many years, and I have used this in JavaScript.",Adding auto-formatting tools in programming editors can help us write clean codes using both concatenation and interpolation styles.
