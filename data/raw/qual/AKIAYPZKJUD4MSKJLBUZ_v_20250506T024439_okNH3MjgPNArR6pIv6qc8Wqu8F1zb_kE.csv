0,4b83afb9,"String Interpolation felt easier to read when it comes to words already stored in variables or strings, while string concatenation works okay for any type. In general though, any of the number ones felt kind of hard to understand in this test, not sure if it was the way it was typed or not. ","Like I said in the previous question, the number ones in general felt horrible for both types, except for a few cases. When it comes the variables holding strings and a word, it was overall not bad. ","Depends on if I am dealing with numbers mainly or strings. String interpolation and concatenation work fine with strings. For numbers, probably leaning more towards interpolation.","In my experiences with coding for far, embedding strings or numbers in variables of sorts makes it easier to use whenever it is needed by just using that variable name or holder. So interpolation is sort of easier for me to understand.","To be honest, not really? I think in general it is a practice thing where the more you use it, the more you get used to it. But If I could recommend an improvement, I think string concatenation needs a better way to ""store"" a number or string prior hand to being used."
