0,67b8e5b8,"I think embedded was easier to read since with concatenation, and specifically c++, it can be a little confusing when you start to ""add"" two different data types.",The main struggle that I had while doing the questions was simply rereading the snippet of code to make sure I understand what it meant,I would choose string interpolation as I feel like it makes code more readable; all you have to do is write the string as you would normally then replace the modifiable information with variables.,"I have coded with Javascript, Python, and C++ before, so I have been exposed to both interpolation and concatenation before. Having experience with these eased my understanding by a lot, as I remember when I first started concatenation was a little unclear to me.","I don't think these should be changed at all; it should just be on the coder themselves to understand how they work and also to not write ugly code with it.
