0,00a4c73e,I preferred the string concatenation but the interpolation was more readable and looked cleaner comparatively. ,"Initially I did not understand how interpolation worked since I am used to coding with concatenation. Visually interpolation looked better and if I had more experience with, no questions asked I would prefer that. ",String concatenation because thats just what I am used to doing. Its sort of intuitive for me. ,I prefer the one in which I have more experience in which is string concatenation even though the other one seemed better. ,I just think its a matter of preference but if people were trained more in the interpolation I think it would be better.
