0,eaf5fb5e,I found string concatenation more readable as I found hat I was able to piece together the pieces faster.,String interpolation was harder for me to read. I took me more time. ,I would prefer string concatenation. Its far easier to understand and faster to debug. ,I am far more familiar with string concatenation so I was better at understanding the snippets that used that method. ,I think string interpolation seems more technical. Perhaps a key would help. I'm not sure.
