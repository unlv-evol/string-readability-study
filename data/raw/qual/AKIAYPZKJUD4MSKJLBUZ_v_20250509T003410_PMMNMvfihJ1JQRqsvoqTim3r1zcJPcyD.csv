0,2a9a91b6,The approach I found more readable was when it used more string concatenation in the survey rather than string interpolation. This is due to the fact that I simply have used concatenation a lot more than interpolation when coding.,"The use of both interpolation and concatenation made it difficult at first to understand what the string was saying, especially when the string got longer and mixed both interpolation and concatenation.","If I had to choose, I would pick string concatenation because I have simply been using concatenation since the beginning when programming. It is by far the simplest way of writing strings in my opinion.","It affected my ease of understanding because I found it very difficult to understand what interpolation was doing to the code since I never used it before. String concatenation on the other hand, I have used since the beginning of coding and because of that, I was able to understand that quickly.","As stated above, I would simply just use string concatenation while I am coding due to ease of understanding."
