0,15b6faab,"I understood concatenation better. However, I have seen it before in my cs classes. Whereas, interpolation or {} I have not seen before. I treated them like quotation marks.","I don't think so. Although some seemed odd or concerning. I possibly did them wrong. However, I think they are very direct if you have former experience using {} these symbols.",I prefer string concatenation. Its less typing. For example a + b is less characters than {a} {b},"Having prior experience with string concatenation made it easier for me to assume the task at hand. For example if I have ""1"" + ""2"", I know Im adding the characters not actual addition, it would become 12.","No, I think its very straightforward."
