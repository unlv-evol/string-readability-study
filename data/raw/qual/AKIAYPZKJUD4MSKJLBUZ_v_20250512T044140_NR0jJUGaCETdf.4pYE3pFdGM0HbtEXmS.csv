I also do not have a lot of experience using string interpolation so that may have been a factor, as well. One of the issues I had was I was not sure how spaces were handled in string interpolation, where as in string concatenation, I knew spaces would be printed if they were in the quotation marks.",I felt using string concatenation made it easier to understand and debug code snippets because it seemed more intuitive and what I was more familiar with.,"I would prefer string concatenation for future programming tasks because I thought it made code more readable. The + sign is universally and immediately more recognizable, signaling that the strings will be combined. I also feel that having less curly braces makes the code appear cleaner and easier to read.","I have less experience with string interpolation so that may be the reason string concatenation seemed more readable to me. Whenever I saw the + sign, I immediately knew that the strings would be combined, which is also why it seemed more intuitive.","Since I am not as familiar with string interpolation, this may just be my initial reaction, but I felt the extra curly braces made the code more cluttered and less readable. I would like more experience using string interpolation to be sure, but that seemed to be the main reason why I preferred using string concatenation."
