For example, the the website problems, I found an easier time finding each part for the concatenation. ","For the more complex examples where just the concatenation and interpolation was shown, I struggled to make sense of both code snippets. I believe it's because the definitions were not given, so my brain had a hard time wrapping my head around how the output should look within a time limit. For example, ""( 0 "" + ""1 )"" with strings and concatenation combined were a little struggling. ","I would choose string concatenation. For me, it was more readable and I had an easier time understanding the code snippets. ","I did impact my ease for the provided code examples. Although, I believe since both concepts are easy to understand, someone who has no knowledge of coding could also understand concatenation and interpolation easily. Since I am familiar with both to a minimal extent, as the questions got harder, I struggled upon what the output should look like. ","Personally, on the surface level I believe both interpolation and concatenation have simple and understandable syntax. So, N/A. "
