0,19fb9b8b,string concatnetation felt more readable because it was easier to understand the syntax and the + sign was very intuitive ,I usually took more time for interpolation because the curly braces made it look more confusing.,i would prefer concatenation because it is a lot easier to read and it only requires one key stroke instead of adding curly braces. it also helps me better understand my own code.,I did not have much experiences with both but the little experience I had with concatenation made it a little easier only because I have seen examples of concatenation before.,"change interpolation to a similar thing as intuitive as concatenation. Similar to how + only requires one character, it makes it easier to read."
