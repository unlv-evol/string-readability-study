0,b1a43cbd,Concatenation because I am more familiar with it. I have maybe used interpolation but it's been awhile.,I was able to read concatenation more effectively and had to rely on the multiple choice to debug the interpolation.,I would choose concatenation unless I became more familiar with interpolation.,I was able to better debug the concatenation as its more familiar to me from projects I've completed or school assignments turned in.,I have no recommendations or suggestions on how debugging could be improved.
