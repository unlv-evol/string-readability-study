0,4cfa0c11,concatenation seemed more readable to me because of the simplicity of it and the spacing being much more readable.,with interpolation I would have to look back a few more times to make sure i was reading it correctly.,concatention is what i would prefer because of how its similiar to what ive alrdy been using.,concatenation is what Im more used to in terms of day to day strings but interplotation is something ive also used here and there.,not really I think it depends on the user for which they prefer.
