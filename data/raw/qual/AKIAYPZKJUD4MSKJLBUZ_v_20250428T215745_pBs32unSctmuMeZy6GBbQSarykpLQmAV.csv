0,b1858df4,"I thought that concatenation was far more readable. Concatenation is widely used and more familiar to me because of its commonality, so I had to learn what ""string interpolation"" was as I was working through the problems. ","Yes, I found string interpolation to be more challenging to understand. Finding the starting and ending curly bracket and mentally substituting the interpolation's contents into the final string felt like unnecessary mental hurdles and concatenation was just simpler because you could append a substring to the final string in your head.","I would definitely use concatenation, it's very easy to mentally work out what you want your code to do when you use concatenation. Interpolation involves substituting in your mind and I find that to be an unnecessary challenge.","I would say that prior familiarity played a very big part. Concatenation is the default in the programming world and since I have been programming (at a basic level) for almost a decade, it's just easier to concatenate two substrings in my head rather than substitute a substring into a large string using interpolation. Perhaps if string interpolation was more used, it would be easier for me.","I don't. The concatenation syntax (+) is already very self explanatory, since you really are just adding the characters of two substrings to each other. The interpolation syntax ({}) seems a little wonky, but I can't think of a better variation."
