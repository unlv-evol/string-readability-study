Tracking what strings to ""put together"" is much easier to track.",Using string concatenation helped me to understand more quickly than interpolation. I find interpolation harder to track on a surface look of the code.,"I prefer string concatenation, I find it much easier to understand and follow compared to string interpolation.",I do not have much experience with string interpolation compared to string concatenation. My experience with string concatenation contributed to my ability to follow the snippets of concatenation much better than the interpolation.
