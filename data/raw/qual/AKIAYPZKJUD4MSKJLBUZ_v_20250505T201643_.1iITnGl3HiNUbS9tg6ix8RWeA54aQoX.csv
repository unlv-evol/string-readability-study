It was one of the first things I learned in regards to strings, and seeing the ""+"" signs helped me visualize what strings were being put together. ","I think the usage of both features allowed me to quickly debug the code snippets. I was constantly flipping between the variables that represented the strings and the output of the code, which helped me piece the outputs a lot faster. ",I would prefer string concatenation.
