0,63c5bdb9,"Usually string interpolation, as it allows to perceive the whole string and see where the values are ""inserted"" rather than as a sequence of possibly mistaken concatenation (which based on language and/or order of characters can lead to different results)","Yes, especially when having multiple values being first computed and then interpolated or concatenated as having interpolation facilitated understanding.","Interpolation, for the afore mentioned reasons. ","Various languages behave differently, having used Python and JavaScript a lot, some of their quirks caused me to ""fumble"" on certain questions and take more time to understand them",Having a standard for programming languages to follow in order to ensure the order of interpolation and/or concatenation (such as str + int + int or int + int + str lead to diff results in some languages)
