0,5e39f827,"I think I found reading interpolation was easier to read because for some examples, it didn't need to use the plus sign as concatenation does and that process takes more time to work on than interpolation.",It affected my ability to quickly understand or debug code snippets because both of them had different approaches when trying to read a natural sentence.,I would prefer to use string interpolation for future programming tasks because it's cleaner and makes the code more organized. An example is how interpolation was used to create a URL in the survey.,"Since I've read code before, I was able to read and understand some of the questions since we're making a string statement at the end. I started coding in C++ in CS 135, which was my first Computer Science class in UNLV, and it helped me understand how to read strings.",N/A
