0,108e1ffd,"String concatenation was easier to read than string interpolation. For example, with interpolation, its harder to read ""{1, 2, 3} 4 3, {4, 5 6}"" than firstList + "" 4, 3, "" + secondList.","String interpolation did affect my ability to understand the code. seems way too cluttered to quickly realize what was going on, while I found concatenation easier to read. Plus, I've never seen string interpolation, as I used concatenation the most.","string concatenation as it's easier to read and I'm already used to. I started with C++, and concatenation is the only way I've used up to this point.","Yes, with concatenation, as I've only coded in C++, x86, and MIPS. I've only taken 3 computer science classes up to this point without really seeing any interpolation.",n/a
