0,2f8ffb2c,"For numbers, I especially found interpolation (""{}"") more readable. When using the + symbol, I would often find myself confusing it with addition. For regular strings or when using variable names, I slightly leaned towards concatenation (""+"") as being easier to read, partially due to my experience with using this symbol most often in my own code. That being said, the longer the sentence and the more often variable names are used, I leaned more and more towards finding interpolation more readable.","Using concatenation did help me understand code snippets primarily in situations involving multiple variables or numbers, as there are no breaks in quotes when using concatenation. If there are many variables used during interpolation, it becomes more and more difficult to follow the quotes and determine where one part ends and a new part begins, as well as whether or not the code is written correctly or if, for example, the variable is accidentally written in quotes while the rest of the string is outside of it. ","I think I would prefer string concatenation for future programming tasks because, in my experience, I have experienced far less mistakes or errors on my end when using concatenation compared to the few times I have used interpolation.","Prior experience has absolutely impacted my ease of understanding the provided code examples, as I was fairly uncertain as to how concatenation worked, especially at the beginning of the study due to how little I have used it in the past or have seen it in my studies.",I have no suggestions or recommendations on how either string interpolation or concatenation syntax could be improved to enhance readability and comprehension.
