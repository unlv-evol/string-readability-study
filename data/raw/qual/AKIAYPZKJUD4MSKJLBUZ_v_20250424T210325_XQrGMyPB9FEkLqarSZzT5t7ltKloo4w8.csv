0,ef5ce2e9,Interpolation because it reduced the amount of quotations marks and minimized the confusion of quotation marks within concatenated strings.,Concatenation impacted it by confusing me on whether or not a quotation mark should be in the output or not and added a lot of symbols that seemed unnecessary in comparison to interpolation.,"Interpolation. Concatenation would be helpful for certain instances, but concatenation can be useful in others. I chose interpolation because it felt easier to identify what the output would be in since brackets are rarely needed in output in comparison to maybe quotation marks.","I do not have much experience with interpolation, but I still found it easier to understand by the end than I did concatenation.","No, I think they're pretty well defined already."
