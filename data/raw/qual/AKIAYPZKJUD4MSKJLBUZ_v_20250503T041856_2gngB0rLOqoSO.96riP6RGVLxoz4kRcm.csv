0,e8068a53,"In the survey, string interpolation was more readable than the other. Concatenation was more readable in code like ""C://"" + home, where there were a lot of symbols mixed in compared to interpolation with ""C://{home}"", but interpolation was more readable in ""a = {a}"" and ""{name}, you scored {score} out of {total}"" than concatenation. ","I have never seen string interpolation before this survey. With concatenation, it can be difficult to read sometimes when there's a lot concatenated. ","I'm inclined to stick with concatenation simply because I'm familiar with it, but if I get more experience with interpolation, I may opt for that in the cases it'd be more readable than concatenation. ","It was difficult to determine how string interpolation worked since I've never seen it before. I only have experience with C++, but my understanding of concatenation was contradicting with the code examples in the survey. There were some like  ""name = "" + name + (1 + 2 + 3)  yet the answer choices would be like ""name = name(123)"" when I thought it'd be invalid. ",
