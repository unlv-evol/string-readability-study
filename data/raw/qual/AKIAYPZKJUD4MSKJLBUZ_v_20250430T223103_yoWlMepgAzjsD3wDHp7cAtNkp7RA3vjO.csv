0,e1960321,"Concatenation felt more like a math problem, which I've looked at math problems since I was in elementary school. Interpolation seemed a lot more complicated, especially trying to discern the { brackets from ( . Too many similar objects. ",I found the string interpolation to be a lot more difficult and time consuming to deconstruct and actually pick out what it was trying to accomplish. ,"I would prefer concatenation, I think it is much more intuitive and the notation is easier to visually dissect into individual pieces. ","Yes, I have only had one coding class and have only briefly heard of interpolation whereas I have used concatenation a few times. Either way I do think concatenation is a bit more intuitive. ","I don't really know enough to have an opinion on that. I think concatenation is pretty simple already, I dont have much experience with it but I feel like I have a decent understanding of it. "
