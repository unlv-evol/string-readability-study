0,49040fd4,I personally like the string interpolation as it leaves it clearer to me personally what is a variable type and what is not,"Yes many times I was confused whether or not something was an actual string or an interpolation, such when there was strings ""[insert word here]"" combined with random numbers that didn't have brackets",I would choose string interpolation as it is clearer to understand what is part of the string and what is variable like,This is actually the first time that I had played with string interpolation and it was an interesting to see what it can do. Concatenation on the other hand I have played with before but not when mixing both strings and random numbers,Perhaps if I had some more documentation prior to doing the tests it would be easier to understand
