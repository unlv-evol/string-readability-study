0,bbfca9f0,I found concatenation a little more readable because the + allows me to know when something ends and begins. ,"Concatenation heleps me quickly understand the debug, becuase without the """" marks, the + would not output, so it allows me to break down each part of the code.","I would use string concatenation because the plus symbol stands out in the code, and you can make it a little more readable",I prioritized experience more than familiarity and going through I was able to easily identify concatenation much easier than string interpolation.,Just make it a little cleaner when writing a big code
