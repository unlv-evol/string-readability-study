0,c766ed7f,interpolation feit more readable . I liked seeing the variables more direct in side of the string. It was more clear as opposed to going back and forth between quotes and plus signs.,interpolation is easier to debug. I didn't have to count spaces or worry about missing the plus at any point.,im still going to go with interpolation for the future for the the sake that is cuts down on syntax and it doesn't have as many errors as concatenation.,concatenation always slows me down and im used to using the + for chaining so when is ee interpolation the examples just became easier for me to handle.,offer consistent multiline syntax across languages and maybe also allow named placeholders to help readability
