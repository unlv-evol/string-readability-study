I don't remember specific examples but say when reading ""x = {x}"" vs ""x = "" + x, I would be able to read the ladder better but the first is very easy to read.",Learning these helps me read syntax a bit more. I believe there is an advantage to reading messy code or just lengthy coding in general.,I think long-term I would prefer interpolation because it would be faster to code using it. It made the code look cleaner and less lines so in my head I feel like it would be faster.,I think learning these skills lets me recognize the pattern to the code examples. Working with strings in past CS classes has helped me understand these snippets.,Interpolation being used in conjunction with concatenation can cause the original concatenated code to be neater.
