0,9b6fa7f6,I am more familiar with string concatenation as I relate the + operator closer to adding two strings than interpolation,"I'm not used to seeing {} when combining strings, so I had to infer what the meaning of it was, and how it differed from concatenation.",I prefer sting concatenation as I think it is a simpler method of viewing the code.,"I am more familiar with is {} for loop statements or containing blocks of code, so when it appeared in interpolation I was confused towards what the purpose was.",I think string interpolation would be more readable if a different operator was used instead of the curly braces.
