I think the {} string stuff is confusing since it breaks with my mentality that the program pretty much treats everything inside quotation marks as a string. In fact, I didn't even know that was a feature. Like, you really cant use {} in strings, since it might do something unexpected? That's very strange to me.","Since I went into this not even knowing about the {}, I originally thought it was a trick, and the right answer was whatever ignored the special functionality it does. But I quickly realized that many questions have all four possible answers that assume that functionality is there, so I quickly got used to it. I don't think the format of the quiz is supposed to change your answers..","Now that I see this interpolation/{} functionality, I could see how it's useful. String concentration takes up more space and, honestly, once I got used to the idea that {} inside """" is special, I realized how that would make things simplier in my programs. Well, except, honestly, I kinda forgot about both of them. Yeah, everytime I want to combine data with cout, I just seperate strings and stuff with <<. But that REQUIRES using cout. I could see how its limited. So yeah, thanks for reminding me about these. We probably mentioned them in my first CS class, but we haven't seen them at all in my current class.","I understood string concatretion already, so the examples were easy to understand. Since I was unfamiliar with interpolation, it threw me off, at least in the beginning.","I can't really comment on interpolation, but the numbers stuff with concentration was a little confusing. Does the program treat them as integers and add them, especially considering they aren't surrounded by """"? There was a question that asked about this, the one that had 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. I definitely would've picked an answer that started with 4 if it was an option. So yeah, it would be good to know how the program treats seeming-integers with respect to string concentration."
