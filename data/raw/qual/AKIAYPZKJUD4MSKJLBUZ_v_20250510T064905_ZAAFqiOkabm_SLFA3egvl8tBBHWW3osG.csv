0,ef1d3a78,I found concatenation more readable because I am more familiar with that technique. I have never seen interpolation before but after seeing a few code snippets I found that I could follow it but it would take me longer. ,I found that it took me longer to understand the code that used interpolation. I thought that some of the code seemed to jumble together when trying to decipher what the task was. I think that concatenation was clear in what it was trying to do. ,I would probably choose concatenation. I think it is more clear in terms of what it is trying to accomplish and is easier to read. ,I think my prior experience influenced me a lot. I have never seen interpolation before and I found that it was messy for me to read. With concatenation I feel there is a clear distinction between the strings and how the code wants to put them together. With interpolation it took me longer to figure out where one string would end and another begin. ,I do not really have any suggestions for concatenation that could improve its readability. I feel that there is already a pretty clear distinction using this technique. I'm not sure how I would improve interpolation. As it is something brand new to me it did take me longer to follow however I almost think that it is a sleeker way to design the code. It would be something I would need to get used to but I think it is ok the way it is.
