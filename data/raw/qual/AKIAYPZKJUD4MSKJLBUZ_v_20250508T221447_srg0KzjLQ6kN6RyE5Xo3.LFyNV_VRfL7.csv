0,e22de289,"I personally found string concatenation to be more readable. This is likely because C++ is the only high-level language I've learned, and am not particularly familiar with the syntax for string interpolation. For example in C++; a = ""Hello "", b = ""World"", cout << a + b;, then the output would be ""Hello World"". Same for when came to string interpolation, a = ""Hello "", b = ""World""  {a}{b}, then the output would be the exact same ""Hello World"". However, the interpolation syntax was confusing as it seemed like putting a space between {a} {b} would implicitly insert a space, even if "" "" was not at the end of a = ""Hello"". Although, at the end of the day it's due to my lack of knowledge and application for string interpolation that leads me to say that string concatenation is more readable.","String concatenation was a bit confusing at first, but I quickly picked up what the syntax doing. I have sufficient experience using and understanding string concatenation, so string concatenation was the only one I struggled with. The only challenge I experienced was determining if a space was implicitly inserted between {a} {b}.","I would personally choose string concatenation because of my understanding and experience using it in C++. Although this is not a definite choice, if other languages used the same/similar syntax for string concatenation, then that would be my preferred choice.","My familiarity and experience with string concatenation helped significantly with understanding the code examples. With the example for string interpolation, I had to take longer to first understand the syntax and see how it operates.","No suggestions for either string interpolation or concatenation syntax. Although I struggled with string interpolation at first, it appears straightforward and identical in function with string concatenation. However for readability, I don't like using {} as they already serve many other uses in code, and can be confusing when trying to analyze or debug a large file. "
