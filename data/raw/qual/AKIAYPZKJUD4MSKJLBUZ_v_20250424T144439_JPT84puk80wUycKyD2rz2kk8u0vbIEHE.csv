0,47fbae2a,I find interpolation to be more readable. F-Strings are my preferred method when dealing with strings if that option is available in the language.,I find interpolation to be quicker to understand and debug. Concatenation can be confusing sometimes as statements get more complex especially if there are non-string items being concatenated with strings.,I prefer interpolation from personal experience. It makes reading code much easier in my opinion. I have used both methods and I think interpolation is superior.,I have a lot of experience using both interpolation and concatenation which helped with understanding the code snippets.,I do not have any recommendations on the syntax but as a user I find using very descriptive variable names helps with readability of both concatenation and interpolation.
