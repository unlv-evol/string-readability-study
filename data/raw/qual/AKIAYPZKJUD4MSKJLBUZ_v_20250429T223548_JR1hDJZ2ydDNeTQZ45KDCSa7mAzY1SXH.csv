0,b347e018,"I found interpolation to be more readable than concatenation because it allows variables to be embedded directly in the string making the output easier to read at a glance. For example, writing ""Hello, {name}!"" is much cleaner and less error-prone than ""Hello, "" + name + ""!"", especially when multiple variables are involved. ","Yes, string interpolation made it easier to quickly understand and debug code since the variables were embedded directly in the string, reducing visual clutter compared to chained concatenation operations ","I would choose string interpolation due to the improved readability, cleaner syntax, and reduced likelihood of syntax errors, especially when working with multiple variables. ","My prior experience with both techniques helped, but I found interpolation examples easier to follow because they more closely resemble natural sentence structure, making the intent of the code clearer and easy to understand",One improvement could be consistent support for interpolation across more languages and better tooling in editors to highlight variables within interpolated strings for quicker comprehension.
