0,d7a03449,String interpolation is much more readable as everything is just in one string and if you need to insert variables you can just put {} instead of having to break it into multiple strings concatenated.,Concatenation slowed down how quickly I could understand the code snippets as I had to use more thinking power to understand how it all went together.,I would prefer to use string interpolation going forward for future programming tasks. Readability is most important factor that influenced this decision which in turn makes it easier to understand.,"For the most part I have used concatenation for working with strings, but only recently have been introduced to string interpolation when working with python. I find it easier now to work with string interpolation.",I don't have any suggestions.
