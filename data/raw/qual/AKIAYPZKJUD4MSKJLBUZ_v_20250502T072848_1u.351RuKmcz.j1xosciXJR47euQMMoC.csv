0,6073919e,I found string concatenation more readable because of the ability to simply replace the variable string in the concatenation. It may also be because I have used string concatenation more than interpolation in the past.,Some challenges that I faced were recognizing whether special characters like brackets or parentheses would be a part of the output or not.,I would use string concatenation because it makes sense to me that adding strings together would just make a longer string. ,"I have learned concatenation in AP Computer Science principles, which has provided me with familiarity with it over interpolation.",I would recommend that these methods could be changed to enhance readability would be having a keyword or a separate symbol instead of the traditional ones that we use.
