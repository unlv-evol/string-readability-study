0,ebc292d2,"I think that both of them have their specific use case. If it is something small, like ""C://user/{username}"", I think it is just more natural to use interpolation. Concatenation can also become messy with numbers since it is technically an overloaded operator.","The only thing that created difficulty was the fact that string interpolation is within quotes. Normally what is in quotes is what is printed but not in this case. Once you do get used to that, the whole thing is more readable.",I would choose interpolation because it is clearer what is going on. Readability-wise it is superior in my opinion. ,I have never used string interpolation but it is no different than search and replace in a document. I have used concatenation with Python before and it is also pretty intuitive although there is more visual clutter and ambiguity.,"If this is for language design, I do not have any suggestions. For a LSP, I suggest visually distinctive colors separating the interpolation from the rest of the string."
