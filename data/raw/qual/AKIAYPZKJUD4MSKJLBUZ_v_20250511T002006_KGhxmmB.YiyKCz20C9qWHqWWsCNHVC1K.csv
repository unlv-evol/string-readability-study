0,e58cd0f8,"I found string interpolation more readable because it clearly shows the intent and structure of the string, as seen in the example ""Hello {name}"", where the variable is directly inserted, reducing confusion compared to concatenation.","String interpolation made it easier to understand and debug the code since the variables were embedded directly within the string, unlike concatenation, which required careful tracking of each operator and variable.","I would prefer string interpolation for future tasks, as it simplifies code readability and reduces the chance of errors, especially in complex strings with multiple variables.","My prior experience with string concatenation made it easier to follow the examples, but string interpolation felt more intuitive and clearer, especially when handling multiple variables in one string.","To improve readability, I suggest using a more consistent and concise syntax for string concatenation, perhaps integrating more features from string interpolation like automatic spacing or format handling."
