With concatenation there is always a pause in the string and this makes it harder to understand how the formatting of the string is written. An example here is whether or not there is space before or after a specific character after referencing a variable. I find it quite annoying to read, but string interpolation is more clearer with understanding the formatting.","I think concatenation caused more trouble. I think most of the my struggles revolved around the use of parentheses and whether or not the values inside of the types are treated as integers or strings. For example, if you have a string with the character sequence (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 )`as seen in some of the examples. To me, it is unclear what type this expression will evaluate to without knowing the type system of the language. In my mind, this would be (4)... and yet this was treated as (1111) instead. I just found it difficult to discern, and this was mainly caused by the string concatenation examples.","String interpolation. The factors that matter to me include ease of writing, ease of getting the correct format you want, and also keeping the code simple for an outside user.
","I am a compiler writer, so I am aware of some of the design issues when it comes to using interpolation and concatenation. Again, most of the examples I was familiar with and the only ones I struggled with understanding are those where I was unsure about how the types were being handled by the compiler. ","It mainly relates back to understanding a language's type system. I believe `{}` should be the de facto standard to use any form of interpolation and anything inside of it should be treated as non-String types until the runtime system needs to convert the value into a string. For concatenation, I would suggest considering a C-like approach with how values replace variables inside of strings as seen in `printf`. This could be declared as a string where all variable values you want to add can be listed at the end of the string. I'm not sure how that will help with writability, but that would be easier to read in my opinion."
