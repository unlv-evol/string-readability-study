0,97ff9b88,The approach I found more readable were the ones involving C++ and quotes. This is the case because this is what was taught during my time in college. I have had little experience with using {} to represent outputs.,"This did affect it slightly, as using { } was not something I have practiced with much before, therefore making me spend more time than usual. However, combining strings with + and "" "" helped greatly because I have practiced this many times before.","I would prefer "" "" and + because this is what I have had the most practice with, therefore making me feel much more comfortable using this in my daily coding practices and exercises.","My prior understanding of "" "" and + impacted my ease of understanding the provided code examples because, since the very beginning of my learning of my coding experience of C++, I have used this constantly, which makes me more inspired to use this as my choice for writing outputs.","I believe the way that it is implemented now is perfectly fine. I believe just a little bit of practice implementing these two can make sense for so many programmers, especially beginners."
