0,e0f5b0b7,I found interpolation more readable because it is easier to just plug in the variable without dealing with all the + signs. I think the + signs make it more confusing especially if there are numbers in the string.,"No, in fact, I think that helped me to debug it even faster. It was easy to just plug in whatever variable it was.",I prefer string interpolation. It is much more readable and less confusing to look at.,"I've had very minimal experience with both, so there really was no impact with either. I've used string interpolation in python a few times and I have only used string concatenation in c++ for some exercises.",Perhaps a different symbol can be used for string concatenation.
