0,2f7de154,"I found concatenation to be more readable because it is easier to distinguish actual text from the names of variables (e.g. it is easier to know that b is a variable in [""Hello"" + b ] than [""Hello {b}""]). String concatenation is also the first method I learned in my first computer science class at UNLV.",Using string interpolation took more time to understand than using string concatenation. It was harder to distinguish text from the names of variables with interpolation as I was not as familiar with it.,"I would choose string concatenation for future programming tasks. This is because I have more experience with concatenation, and I did not know about string interpolation before this survey.","Prior to this survey, I had only learned and used string concatenation and have never encountered or heard of string interpolation. Therefore, it was more difficult to understand the examples that used interpolation.",No
