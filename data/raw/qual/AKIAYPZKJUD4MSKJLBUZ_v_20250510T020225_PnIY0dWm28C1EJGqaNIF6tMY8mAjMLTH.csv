0,142e860f,I liked interpolation a little more when there was more going on since it helped know when a variable was getting inserted.,I was a little faster at reading interpolation.,Id pick string interpolation since I was able to read it faster.,I haven't really done a lot of either so I dont think It factored much.,Picking when to use it over the other for simple examples concatenation is simply to read but once there is more going on I think to use interpolation.
