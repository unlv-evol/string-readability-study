I recognize it for certain things in Python, but since I've mostly been thinking in C++ and often use the +, then that's what I just am more familiar with. ","I think using the interpolation made it a bit slower for me. I was also honestly tripped up about the typos within the doc. It said John Deo, which made me think I was messing up while reading. ","I would prefer concatenation, unless I understood the interpolation more. I think they probably each have their best use cases, so I would also consider that when deciding what is best to use. ","I think using concatenation in custom classes made it a bit easier to understand what was happening. I don't have as much with interpolation, and I would have enjoyed a brief summary or description of the two before beginning the study. ","I would suggest trying to make sure the wording on the survey does not have typos and maybe add in brief descriptions of the concepts, just in case someone may not be familiar with one or the other."
