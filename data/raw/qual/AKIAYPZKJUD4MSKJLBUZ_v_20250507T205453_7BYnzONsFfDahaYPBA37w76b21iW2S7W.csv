0,74c20395,I think string concatenation is more simple and readable in most cases except when having to check for correct spacing. String interpolation is easier to read spacing-wise because it flows like natural reading.,.,I personally prefer reading string concatenations even though it can get tedious with spacing. It works well in my brain just adding the strings together back to back.,I think my coding background highly increased my ease of understanding the provided examples. It came more naturally to me compared to someone who doesn't have experience reading code.,"I think as a general rule of thumb when using concatentation, you should always leave strings cleanly without spaces at the end and just include a spacer string between concatenations if you need it. Ex: ""this"" + "" "" + ""boy"" versus ""this "" + ""boy"""
