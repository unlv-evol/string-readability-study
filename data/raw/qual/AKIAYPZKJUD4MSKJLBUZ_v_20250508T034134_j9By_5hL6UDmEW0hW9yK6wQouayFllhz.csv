0,c43615ec,"I found string interpolation most readable, especially with examples where the variable names were {userName}, {domain}, {path}. It was much easier to decipher what the console would print from the cout statement rather than adding different strings together. String concatenation joins strings together in the order they are added, which sometimes confused me with integer addition which is completely different. ","Typically when writing code, I use string concatenation since that was the way I was taught to add strings but it seems like interpolation is much more readable.","I think it would depend on the circumstance---the curly braces for interpolation can make the code look overwhelming if there are many strings that need to be joined together, whereas the plus symbol seems most readable to me. For simple print statements of statements were numbers are being printed, interpolation seems best to me. In other cases, I would use concatenation. ","Prior to this survey, I had not been exposed to interpolation so I was a bit confused with some of the code snippets, but intuitively understood that whatever is stored in the variable between the curly braces would be printed. ",I do not have any suggestions.
