0,c75f1b9a,find any replacement for whats inside {} and if none is provided then just use the value in the {},definitely slowed my speed as im not very fast or used to this kind of approach,interpolation as it seems easier to break down,not really as my previous coding knowledge doesnt have anything really similar to this.,maybe if I were more familiar with it or of it had a clear indication when a variable is to be read or if its to be printed.
