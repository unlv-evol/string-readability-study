Since it uses algebraic expression, (+) and the brain is already tuned to it from its daily use so it is easier to foresee or come up with the output","I needed a few minutes to think when attempting interpolation, basically because of its structure. You needed to accurately place the variables in their right place in the string.  Whereas in concatenation, it was much easier to predict what the next item in the string was if (+) was met","Honestly, I use both in my normal programming, but I would definitely use concatenation for simple, straightforward tasks where, for example, the string lengths are already short. But I would use interpolation for more complex tasks, especially if it involves very, very long strings. Concatenations would require a lot of work and make it harder to read if the string was 5 to 10 lines of code long.","Well, I needed to remember from experience that spaces are maintained by the compiler when working with strings. Anyone who has not had live experience with that will not be aware.",None that I can think of right now
