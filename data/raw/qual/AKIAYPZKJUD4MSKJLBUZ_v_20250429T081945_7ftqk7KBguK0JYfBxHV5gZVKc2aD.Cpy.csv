0,9fdb488e,"string concatenation was more readable. I have never actually used string interpolation but even after looking it up, it felt much less readable than concatenation felt when I first learned about it. I think concatenation just feels more natural because the quotations basically work the same way they do in language. The interpolation examples really threw me off and were a bit overwhelming. I'm  probably just too used to concatenation.","string interpolation examples took more time, felt less natural. Not used to it so I think my brain kinda melted and I started to mix everything up.","On a deadline, I would just go with concatenation because it's what I've always used but I think I see the advantage to interpolation. It seems cleaner but takes some getting used to probably. After spending some more time with it, I think there's a good chance I'd come to prefer interpolation.",I've only used concatenation so it felt much more natural.,"I'm not sure, I think they're in a good place. Concatenation has always felt very intuitive but the syntax does start to feel redundant sometimes. Not sure what you do about that, though. Interpolation seems like a good answer to that, even though it feels a bit less natural. Not sure how I'd change it for myself without ruining it for others, though. I think maybe changing the symbols used for syntax / doubling them up (like the ternary operator using two symbols) maybe would be clearer to me personally but that's probably just worse I guess."
