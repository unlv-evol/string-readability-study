0,bc141bf2,"String interpolation helps to easier deduct if there will be spaces because you only need to check the value of the variable that is put in, not whether or not there is also a space.","Sometimes if there are many different variables and sometimes there are spaces or no spaces, it was easy to read but sometimes hard to get the exact formatting right.","String interpolation has my preference, I appreciate that you can do formatting from there, without adapting the variable you want to put in the string, particularly if you have many decimal points and want to round them.","I have used string interpolation quite a lot recently, concatenation slightly less but I understood how to read them at least.","If possible, colorcoding the variables would help to easier see, or, but this might be dreaming, a preview of how a string would look (in terms of formatting), that you can hover over, like you can do in Overleaf with mathematical expressions."
