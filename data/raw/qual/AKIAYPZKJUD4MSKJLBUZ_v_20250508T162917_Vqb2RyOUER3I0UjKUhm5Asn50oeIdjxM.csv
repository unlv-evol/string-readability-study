0,2cc85fc2,"I find concatenation more readable and clear, probably because I've always used it.","Interpolation was useful when it was clear (for example: ""name = {name} age = {age}""). But otherwise, I find concatenation to be more clear (for example: { ( {1} {2} ) } was unclear).",I would choose concatenation as it feels more precise and clear.,"I haven't used interpolation much, so I was much more familiar with concatenation. This made it easier to understand concatenation rather than interpolation.","I'm not sure of a great solution for this, but using {1} to mean ""1"" felt unnecessary, and { ( {1} {2} {3} ) } was unclear."
