0,7222da5a,"String interpolation was easier to follow along and more readable because it was like reading a key. with string interpolation I could just go back and forth replacing what needed to be replaced to get the correct answer. Whereas with string concatenation though it was cleaner and less cluttered reading it felt like a trick question because looking at it felt like reading code, and string interpolation felt like general math.","Yes, I found I was faster reading string interpolation because it was like doing elementary math in my head, whereas with string concatenation I stalled. Especially with spaces, I felt like I would get the answers incorrect because the brackets felt misleading. I didn't feel as comfortable with string concatenation.","I would prefer string interpolation because it didn't feel like programming, it felt like id already done that sort of debugging before. I found myself analyzing the problems with more confidence because it was like ""plugging and chugging"" as they say in math. With string concatenation, I found myself taking a second look at my answer because of the notation.","I've only had experience with the programming language C++, so I wasn't absolutely confused by neither string interpolation nor concatenation. Reading them were simple, direct, and concise. Therefore the debugging experience was not frustrating. But comparing the two, I found string interpolation safer to learn from. ","I find that learning any programming language can be difficult and often visually difficult to interpret. And if asked to debug or understand some piece of syntax, I think color coding is important because most students would get the logic down without needing to read the directions, sending less time second guessing their answer. if color isn't an option, bolding text can make the syntax easier to read and follow along.
