The use of { } and quotes within quotes made it harder for someone who does not know the language being used to read the string.,"For code that gave a clear and concise method of creating strings, the code was instantaneously easier to read. I found great difficulty in reading the snippets of code with too much left to question like the lack of keywords, clear strategy, or other.",I find that utilizing string interpolation makes code easier to read and understand from an outside perspective that is not the programmer who wrote the code. ,"I have seen string concatenation be utilized primarily for program headers or when a program demands input from the user, giving it a more static definition than string interpolation does. Therefore, as I took this examination, I failed to understand why some of the concatenated strings needed to be concatenated rather than output directly.","The better the formatting, the easier it is to read. For the longer lines of code, I found myself blurring the characters between what I assume the computer would see as an ASCII character, or as a definition for the programming language."
