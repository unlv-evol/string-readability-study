0,fa848178,"I am used to string concatenation, but never really encounter string interpolation. I think I liked string interpolation more, because I did not have to worry about reading the + symbol. I think the brackets are easier to read and it's easier to figure out what is supposed to be within the brackets. {}","I think string concatenation was harder for me to read as I had to think about what snippets were tied together, and whether the + was actually concatenating strings together or being used in a string. Example: ""Hello "" + ""World""  vs. 1 "" + "" 2
I think my only problem with string interpolation is that I did not know what it was initially.",I would prefer to use string interpolation because I don't really use string concatenation anyways. I think interpolation could be easier to work with and it reminds me of just working with string variables.,"I think I had an easier time understanding the concatenation code based on my prior experience with it, and had a harder time with interpolation because I did not quite know what it was. However, once I understood, I think interpolation is easier.",N/A
