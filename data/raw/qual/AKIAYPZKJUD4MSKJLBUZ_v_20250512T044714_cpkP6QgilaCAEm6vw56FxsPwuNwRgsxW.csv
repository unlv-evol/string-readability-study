0,53bbf399,I think its easier to know more about concatenation than interpolation.,harder to understand interpolation cuz it confused me a lot more,concatenation because of how simplistic it is.,I think I used concatenation to make it easier to understand interpolation.,maybe have interpolation come with instructions.
