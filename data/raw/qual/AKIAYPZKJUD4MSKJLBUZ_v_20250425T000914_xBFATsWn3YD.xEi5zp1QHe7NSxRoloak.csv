0,29b8cfa1,Interpolation. I found that is was more clear and I didn't have to think as hard.,Using string concatenation sometimes made debugging harder because it was tricky to see where variables ended and strings began,"Interpolation because it's cleaner and easier to read, especially when combining multiple variables into one string","My prior experience with string concatenation in earlier classes helped me understand the code examples more easily, but I had to adjust a bit to string interpolation since it was new to me and looked different from what I was used to.","I think string concatenation could be improved by reducing the number of plus signs needed, and string interpolation could be clearer with more distinct formatting to separate variables from the rest of the string."
