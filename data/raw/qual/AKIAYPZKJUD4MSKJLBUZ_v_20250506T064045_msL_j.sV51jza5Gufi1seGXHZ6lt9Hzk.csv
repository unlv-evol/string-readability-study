I wouldn't say that I'm some genius or expert in computer science/coding, but have decent understanding of C++ due to my college classes. Just based on C++ and my experiences, I am more familiar with string concatenation than interpolation. ","Concatenation isn't a syntax I'm particularly familiar with, I know we've learned it before but it isn't something that I typically use or encounter in my classes. There were specific syntax issues that I found confusing with interpolation. For example if it said {a + b}, a = ""Hello"", b = ""World"", I would assume the correct output would be HelloWorld, but found that sometimes spaces are inserted during interpolation? Unless I misunderstood how it was working, I assumed spaces being inserted was the case, so I assumed the output was actually Hello World, where the space was inserted.
 ","I would choose string concatenation just based on familiarity. Although interpolation was something I am not familiar with, if there are more common uses cases then it could be true that I would use string interpolation more. Just based on my current situation, I find myself choosing to use string concatenation more often than string interpolation.","My previous experiences and familiarity helped significantly with understanding string concatenation, but on the other hand I think my lack of understanding string interpolation impacted my performance negatively. String concatenation was just one of the first things we were taught in computer science, and always found the concept simple. I found myself using it a lot more frequently than interpolation, even though both concepts were taught (at different points in my academic career).",I don't think I have any suggestions. I personally believe my lack of knowledge in interpolation was the key factor in preferring concatenation over interpolation.
