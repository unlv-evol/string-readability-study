0,22be8405,"String concatenation is more readable for me because it keeps everything straightforward and separated, making it easier to control how the string is built. For example, ""Hello, "" + name + ""!"" is clear about what’s being added to the string, while interpolation can sometimes be harder to track when more variables are involved.","Using string concatenation didn’t affect my ability to understand or debug code much, but when there are multiple variables, it can become a bit harder to follow. The + operator clearly shows how the pieces are connected, but long expressions can look cluttered.","I would prefer string concatenation for future tasks because it feels more explicit and flexible. I can easily add spaces, punctuation, or different variables without worrying about the format of the string.","My prior experience with concatenation made understanding the provided code examples easier. I’m used to seeing the + operator, so it felt natural and intuitive to read through the code.","To improve string concatenation, I think using clearer functions or syntax (like automatically handling spaces) could make it more readable. A simpler way to insert variables into strings without worrying about + could make the code look cleaner."
