0,5280fd2e,"I believe complete string interpolation like https://{domain_name}/{path}/{a.id} is more readable because the string is already partially made for us, as compared to a string concatenation like hvar + domain_name + ""/"" + url + ""/"" + a.id. The second example I made above is also longer and thus requires more reading and keen eyes to follow, therefore being less readable to me.","No challenges to using string interpolation or concatenation when understanding or debugging code, but I did feel more of an advantage when it came to strings that were more string interpolated heavy. I feel like they gave me an advantage mainly when it came to readability.","I would choose string interpolation for future programming tasks, the main factor that influenced my choice is because in python (as of late) I have used a lot more string interpolation in my string outputs than actual concatenation.","My prior experience with both string interpolation and concatenation played a role in understanding the provided code examples, for example I feel like I have a keen experience on keeping track of variables within {}, noticing beginning "" and ending "" then distinguishing how the string would look.","No suggestion or recommendation that came to mind as I did this survey, but I do now better like string interpolation over concatenation."
