In the snippets where numeric values were used it became confusing to understand what brackets represented in a non quoted part. Although that was confusing for snippets with concatenation as well.","For both it depends strongly on the documentation of the interpolation or concatenation syntax. Multiple programming languages have tried to implement it in a straight-forward way, only to end up with odd edge cases where the behavior is unexpected.","I think it hindered me, because some programming languages have non-intuitive syntaxes for both interpolation and concatenation. This resulted in me sometimes coming up with an answer before reading the options and seeing that I agreed with none of them.",-
