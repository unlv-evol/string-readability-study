With interpolation, you start seeing different pieces all in the same string which can start to get visually confusing when there is a lot of interpolation in the same string. Concatenation spaces it out in a more readable format.","Once parentheses started being added, it became more challenging to quickly understand what was going on. Simple string interpolation and concatenation did not hinder my ability to understand the code snippets.","I would choose string concatenation. It makes more visual sense to me when programming. One of my reasons is that UNLV starts with teaching the C++ programming language. When writing code for output on programming assignments, it is common to use concatenation to match the intended output. Because of that, my brain is trained to think like that when it comes to programming in general.",My experience with C++ and string concatenation made it easier to understand the concatenation examples. Interpolation is not as commonly used within the UNLV curriculum which gives me a lot less experience with it.  ,"I think the way we use spaces can become a readability challenge. If both interpolation and concatenation were used in the same program that I was reviewing, I would need to think about what the actual string will be. For example, concatenation of this: ""my dog"" + dogName + ""is a good boy"" where dogName = Spot, would result in the string ""my dogSpotis a good boy"" even though there are spaces visible in the concatenation. Now if this was changed to interpolation it would look like: ""my dog {dogName} is a good boy"" and the result would be ""my dog Spot is a good boy"" with the spaces included. A quick review of a program would require some thought to understand the exact output when using interpolation and concatenation."
