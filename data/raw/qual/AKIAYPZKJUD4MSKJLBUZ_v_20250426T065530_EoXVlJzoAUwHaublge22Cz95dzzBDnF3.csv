I prefer ""Hello {name}, {intro}!/n""","Using interpolation was definitely easier. When viewing concat, I had to really focus in and keep referring back to the variables which caused me to lose my place sometimes. The brackets made it easier to refer back to the spot I was replacing in my mind.","I would prefer string interpolation. I used to work with Javascript and when using it in React, I found it easier to understand what was going to be replaced during certain events.","I think just having the previous experience with interpolation definitely made it easier to read. I would always prefer interpol vs concat, because there isn't a lot of """" """" """" """" breaking the code and made it easier to read. Especially in web app development.","Brackets all the way, ++ to learn concepts, and when it's on hard lock, move on to {}"
