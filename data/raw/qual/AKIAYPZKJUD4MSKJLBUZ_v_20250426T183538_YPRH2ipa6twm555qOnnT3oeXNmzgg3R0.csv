0,af6e6ccb,"String concatenation was more readable in most circumstances as I was more familiar with it. I also wasn't fully aware of how interpolation worked and what you expected my response to be. For example, I had no idea what {(3 0 1)} could mean. I usually just selected the ones without the braces unless I was given a particular value to substitute in. However, where particular values were provided and there was just one string like a=5, b=6, something like ""there are {a} cats and {b} dogs"" is more readable than concatenation, if not by much. ","Yes, the constant parentheses, especially if there is more than one set greatly confused me when doing this. For example there was one question where it was like ""...""5""..."" which seemed to me like 5 should be excluded from the parentheses but there was no + to concatenate so I was confused. Interpolation is confused to begin with as I was not familiar with it. ",I would prefer concatenation as it generally more readable and I am more familiar with it. ,Concatenation was much easier simply because I have used it a lot while I have never used interpolation before.  For example I didn't know what {(1 0 3)} is supposed to mean. ,"I feel like part of it could be improved with colored text to clearly indicate what is inside and outside of a string, like what many programing platforms like VSC do.
