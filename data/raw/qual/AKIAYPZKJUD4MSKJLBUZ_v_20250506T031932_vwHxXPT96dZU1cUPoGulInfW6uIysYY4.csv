0,771f4a8a,I prefer concatenation as the plus symbols just make it easier for me personally to see what's a part of what.,I did take a bit of time trying to figure out in the concatenation cases whether it was straight up writing the word or not and whether the curly brackets were actually parentheses.,I would prefer concatenation simply because I find the plus signs easier to find and read than curly brackets.,"I've always used string concatenation prior to this, so concatenation is a much more unfamiliar syntax to me.","I just think, that when there are parentheses on the same line, the curly brackets in interpolation make code much harder to read."
