0,0435c2b8,I found string concatenation more readable. Interpolation made it very difficult on what to ignore and what was actually going to be outputted. Concatenation allowed me to just look for the quotation marks.,"Concatenation was very easy to read, but with interpolation, it took significantly longer. Part of that is due to me being unfamiliar with interpolation, but it still remained harder to read than concatenation. ",I believe that string interpolation may have a better use case than concatenation and I believe that my readability is based on which I am more familiar with. I would experiment with string interpolation to see if it yields better results for me.,"I have probably used string concatenation solely through my education, so seeing string interpolation was very different and hard at times to understand what I am reading.","I think that having the string all in black text makes in confusing to read. When using a text editing program and having different colors would increase readability in my opinion. Otherwise I think that there isn't much improvement, just getting more familiar with the syntax would be the biggest help."
