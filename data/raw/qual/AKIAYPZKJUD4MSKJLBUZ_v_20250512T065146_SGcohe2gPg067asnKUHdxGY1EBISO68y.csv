0,1c9401ec,"Interpolation became a bit more clear to me as i went on if i understood it correct. I think it makes a great effort to make strings and use values or variables in the output in a robust and dynamic matter, which i like.","It took a bit of time to just piece it together, but just casual checking to make sure the output would indeed match, not bringing any challenges. ","I think I am more used to concatenation, but I like the robustness of interpolation and would be excited to try it out and implement it.",Prior understanding of concatenation provided a decent foundation to understand interpolation a bit on the fly and made it a bit easier to try and choose the correct output. ,"I think this is pretty readable, perhaps with more background knowledge It would be even more seamless. One thing I didnt completely catch was how the spaces always work in interpolation, but I could have just been reading or thinking about it wrong. "
