0,19c65222,"In some questions interpolation was easier to understand while in other questions concatenation was easier to understand so I believe you have to take it from a case by case basis. In my personal opinion, interpolation was easier for me to read.",interpolation was easier to understand because there was a clear difference between what is being printed outright and what is being replaced with a corresponding value.,"I would choose interpolation because like I said in question two, setting a clear difference between a string being outputted and a value being replaced makes the code easier to read.",I don't believe my prior experiences made a major difference in my ability to read the strings. Both interpolation and concatenation can be easily taught.,No.
