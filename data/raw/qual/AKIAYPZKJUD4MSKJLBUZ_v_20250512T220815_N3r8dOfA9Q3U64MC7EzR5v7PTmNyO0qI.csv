0,5fa10aff,"I considered string concatenation to be more readable than interpolation, because I'm more familiar with concatenation. For example, file navigation was easier to differentiate what was a literal and what was a string variable.","Yes, I'm not used to string interpolation so I often had to stop and deduce the code or values that would be substituted in interpolation.",I would choose concatenation as I'm more familiar and used to using it.,It greatly affected my understanding as I had virtually no familiarity with string interpolation and have been using concatenation exclusively in C++ for the past couple of years.,Having literals and string variables spaced out typically makes it easier to read.
