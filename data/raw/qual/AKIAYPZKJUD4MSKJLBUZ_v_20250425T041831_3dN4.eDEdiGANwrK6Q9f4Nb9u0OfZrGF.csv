0,77e9dde2,"They both felt equally as readable once I got the hang of it, but at first, string concatenation was more readable. I think this is because I am used to the notion of + or so than insertion with interpolation.","At first, yes. Using interpolation messed up my ability slightly more. This is simply because my brain needed a moment to input the given variable into the place where the brackets were.","If I were tasked to choose, I would choose concatenation. This is because for myself, It's more easily readable, and frankly more simple.","I think any understanding anyone has of coding would help ease understanding. If I needed to give a reason why, It's simply because I'm familiar with the syntax of some coding, which helps me to read it.","I think both ways are pretty simple, and there's nothing to change that could make it significantly easier to understand. I enjoy both, with the little experience I have."
