Specifically, I was never taught interpolation till now, also I think concatenation is easier to understand the breaks, or what is being combined. An example would be how doing ""username: "" + name + "" is taken"" is, in my view easier to distinguish that 'name' is a variable as opposed to a part of the string compared to using interpolation: ""username: {name} is taken"".","Using interpolation makes it kind of hard for me to understand or debug code snippets as the use of  ""{}"" kind of messes with how I view a code snippet, makes it seem kind of like a function call rather than string interpolation. Meanwhile occasionally using the symbol ""+"" gets kind of confusing when using numbers, is it asking to add them or concatenate it into a string.",I would prefer using string concatenation as using a plus and quotation marks makes it easy to separate and identify the parts of a string.,"With little to no experience in using string interpolation, as it was never or only briefly touched upon in class, I think I did better on the questions focused on string concatenation. That is to say I am biased towards string concatenation.","No, I find that string interpolation or concatenation syntax is pretty self explanatory and easy to understand, expect maybe use a different kind of braces for interpolation."
