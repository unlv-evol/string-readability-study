0,a63a3389,"With my experience, I find string concatenation more readable because it is what I am used to. When I see the addition sign between two strings, my brain automatically registers what the concatenated string would look like.",No I've never faced any challenges with debugging due to string interpolation/concatenation.,I would choose string concatenation because the syntax looks more pleasing to the eye and easier to read.,"In my personal experience, my computer science professors have never used string interpolation, so I was never taught how to use it.","I don't have any suggestions for string concatenation. However, for string interpolation, I recommend changing the syntax a bit. For example, if I had two string variables A and B, instead of writing {B}{A}, I think it would look more readable if it were written as {B, A} because it seems less cluttered."
