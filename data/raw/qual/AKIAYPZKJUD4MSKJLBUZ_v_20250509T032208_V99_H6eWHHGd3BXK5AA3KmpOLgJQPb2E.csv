0,77ddcb3f,"I found interpolation to be more readable because it got rid of unnecessary spaces that clog up my reading when using concatenation. With interpolation, all that separates a pure string from a variable being dereferenced is ""{"" and ""}"", whereas with concatenation, it's ""' + "" and/or "" + '"".",The code snippets that used interpolation seemed to be more quickly understandable to me than the code snippets that used concatenation. The interpolation read quickly for me whereas my eyes had to scan back and forth to understand the concatenations sometimes. This was further worsened when the two were mixed together.,"I would prefer string interpolation cause it is more condensed, faster to write, and easier to read.","While I've had lots of familiarity with string concatenations I've had very little experience with string interpolation before. However, I was almost immediately able to catch onto the code snippets utilizing interpolation. Additionally, I still had a hard time reading the snippets utilizing concatenation.","I like the syntax of concatenation, however interpolation uses braces, which are also often used by higher level code objects like functions. So instead, I might prefer the use of ""<"" and "">"" rather than braces."
